    <p class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong><a name="Point1"></a><u>Origin of the Senate: The Great Compromise</u></strong></p>
    <p>On July 16, 1787, the fifty-five Founding Fathers meeting in Philadelphia  reached what is commonly called the "Great Compromise." The compromise emerged  from the struggle between the large states and the small states over the  apportionment of seats in the Congress. The Framers easily accepted by principle  of bicameralism-a two-house national legislature-but disagreed strongly over how  each chamber would be constituted. This was the most contentious issue at the  Constitutional Convention and nearly led to its dissolution. The large states  favored the "nationalist" principle of popularly-based representation, but the  smaller states insisted on a "federal" principle ensuring representation by  states. The smaller states feared that if representation was based on  population, the larger states would quickly dominate the new Congress.</p>
    <p>In the end, the Framers reached an agreement: House seats would be  apportioned among the states based on population and Representatives would be  directly elected by the people; the Senate would be composed of two Senators per  state-regardless of size or population-indirectly elected by the state  legislature. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 39, "The House of  Representatives will derive its powers from the people of America....The Senate,  on the other hand, will derive its powers from the States, as political and  co-equal societies; and these will be represented on the principle of equality  in the Senate." The principle of two Senators from each state was further  guaranteed by Article V of the Constitution: "no State, without its Consent,  shall be deprived of equal Suffrage in the Senate."</p>
    <p>Decisions made at the Constitutional Convention about the Senate still shape  its organization and operation today, and make it unique among national  legislative institutions. William E. Gladstone, four-time British Prime Minister  during the 19th century, said the United States Senate, is a "remarkable body,  the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics." Plainly, the  Framers did not want the Senate to be another House of Representatives, and the  institutional uniqueness of the upper house flows directly from the decisions  they made at the Constitutional Convention.</p>
    <p>Several of those constitutional decisions led to important and enduring  features of the Senate and its legislative process. These features include  constituency, size, term of office, and special prerogatives.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Constituency</strong></p>
    <p>The one state - two Senator loorormula means that all Senators represent  constituencies that are more heterogeneous than the districts represented by  most House members. As a result, Senators must accommodate a larger range of  interests and pressures in their representational roles. Further, because each  Senator has an equal vote regardless of his or her state's population, the  Senate remains a oddly apportioned institution: Senators from the twenty-six  smallest states, who (according to the 2000 census) represent 17.8% of the  nation's population, constitute a majority of the Senate--a reality which has  aroused little public interest or concern.</p>
    <p>The Framers, of course, could not have foreseen the country's population  increases, migratory patterns, or huge disparities in state sizes. While Members  from small and large states all have comparable committee and floor  responsibilities, few are likely to deny that Senators from the more populous  states, such as California, face a broader array of representational pressures  than lawmakers from the smaller states, such as Wyoming. An indirect effect of  Senate apportionment, some scholars contend, is that contemporary floor leaders  of either party are likely to come from smaller rather than larger states  because they can better accommodate the additional leadership workload.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Size</strong></p>
    <p>The one state - two Senator formula also meant that from the outset the  Senate's membership was relatively small compared to the House. When it first  convened it March 1789, there were twenty-two Senators (North Carolina and Rhode  Island soon entered the Union to increase the number to twenty-six). As new  states entered the Union, the Senate's size expanded to the 100 that it is  today.</p>
    <p>The Senate's relatively small size has significantly shaped how it works. In  the smaller and more intimate Senate, vigorous leadership has been the exception  rather than the rule. The relative informality of Senate procedures testifies to  the looser reins of leadership. Significantly, there is large deference to  minority views and all Senators typically have ample opportunities to be heard  on the issues of the day. Compared with the House's complex rules and voluminous  precedents, the Senate's rules are brief and often set aside. Informal  negotiations among Senators interested in a given measure are commonplace.  Although too large for its members to draw their chairs around the fireplace on  a chilly winter morning--as they did in the early years--the Senate today  retains a clubby atmosphere that the House lacks.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Term of Office, Qualifications, and Selection</strong></p>
    <p>A key goal of the Framers was to create a Senate differently constituted from  the House so it would be less subject to popular passions and impulses. "The use  of the Senate," wrote James Madison in Notes of Debates in the Federal  Convention of 1787, "is to consist in its proceedings with more coolness, with  more system and with more wisdom, than the popular branch." An oft-quoted story  about the "coolness" of the Senate involves George Washington and Thomas  Jefferson, who was in France during the Constitutional Convention. Upon his  return, Jefferson visited Washington and asked why the Convention delegates had  created a Senate. "Why did you pour that coffee into your saucer?" asked  Washington. "To cool it," said Jefferson. "Even so," responded Washington, "we  pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it."</p>
    <p>To foster values such as deliberation, reflection, continuity, and stability  in the Senate, the Framers made several important decisions. First, they set the  senatorial term of office at six years even though the duration of a Congress is  two years. The Senate, in brief, was to be a "continuing body" with one-third of  its membership up for election at any one time. As Article I, section 3, states:  "Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election,  they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes." Second, to be a  Senator, individuals had to meet different qualifications compared to service in  the House of Representatives. To hold office, Senators have to be at least 30  years of age and nine years a citizen; House members are to be 25 years and  seven years a citizen. Senators, in brief, were to be more seasoned and  experienced than representatives. Finally, the indirect election of Senators by  state legislatures would serve to check precipitous decisions which might  emanate from the directly elected House and buttress the states' role as a  counterweight to the national government.</p>
    <p>Direct election of Senators came with the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in  1913. A byproduct of the Progressive movement, it was designed to end corruption  in state legislatures (involving the purchase of Senate seats), blunt the power  of party machine bosses and corporations, prevent deadlocks in the election of  Senators, and make Senators directly answerable to the people for their actions  and decisions.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Special Prerogatives</strong></p>
    <p>Although the House and Senate share all lawmaking authority, including  overriding presidential vetoes, the Framers assigned special prerogatives to the  Senate. Under the Constitution's "advice and consent" provisions (Article II,  section 2), only the Senate considers the ratification of treaties (which  requires a two-thirds vote) and presidential appointments for such positions as  federal judgships, ambassadorships, or Cabinet offices (all of which require a  majority vote for approval). The Framers entrusted "advice and consent" duties  exclusively to the Senate in part because they expected these matters to be  handled in a thoughtful and responsible manner. The qualities they embedded in a  continuing body--stability, experience, and a longer perspective--were valuable  in handling issues involving national security and international relations. The  Senate's role in the appointments process, wrote Alexander Hamilton in  Federalist No. 76, would serve as "an excellent check upon the spirit of  favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to preventing the  appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection,  from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity."</p>
    <p>The Constitution (Article I, section 3) also grants the Senate the "sole  Power to try all Impeachments." The House possesses the constitutional authority  to decide by majority vote whether to impeach (or indict) executive or judicial  officials while the Senate, by a two-thirds vote, determines whether to convict  and remove from office any impeached official. "Where else," wrote Alexander  Hamilton in Federalist No. 65, "than in the Senate could have been found a  tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body  would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve  unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual  accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers?" (Italics in  original)</p>
    <p>Understandably, the Senate's constitutional origins continue to shape its  organization and operations. Three features in particular are noteworthy,  because they contribute to making the Senate the unique institution that it is.  They are extended debate, the lack of formal party leaders until the early  1900s, and the use of unanimous consent to conduct most of its business.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Extended Debate</strong></p>
    <p>All Senators have two traditional freedoms that, so far as is known, no other  legislators worldwide possess. These two freedoms are unlimited debate and an  unlimited opportunity to offer amendments, relevant or not, to legislation under  consideration. The small size of the Senate permitted these traditional freedoms  to emerge and flourish, subject to very few restrictions. Not until 1917 did the  Senate adopt its first cloture rule (Rule XXII). Thus, from 1789 until 1917,  there was no way for the Senate to terminate extended debates (called  "filibusters" if employed for dilatory purposes) except by unanimous consent,  compromise, or exhaustion.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Floor Leaders</strong></p>
    <p>Throughout the 19th century, many Senators were called "leaders" by their  colleagues, commentators, scholars, or others. But no single Senator exercised  central management of the legislative process in the manner of today's floor  leader. As late as 1885, Woodrow Wilson could write in his classic study,  Congressional Government, "No one is the Senator.... No one exercises the  special trust of acknowledged leadership." (Italics in original) No doubt the  small size of the early Senate and the tradition of viewing Members as  "ambassadors" from sovereign states promoted an informal and personal style of  senatorial leadership. Although the general scholarly consensus is that certain  Senators began to function formally as party leaders in the early 1900s, the  minutes of the respective party caucuses indicate that Democrats officially  elected their "leader" in 1920; Republicans followed suit five years later.  Floor leaders acquired procedural resources over time, such as their right of  preferential recogniton, that helped them to manage the Senate's work. However,  their formal powers are limited and many floor leaders have said that their job  is akin to "herding cats."</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Unanimous Consent</strong></p>
    <p>From its beginning, the Senate has transacted much of its business by  unanimous consent. The Senate's small size, few rules, and informality  encouraged the rise of this practice. A single objection ("I object") blocks a  unanimous consent request. Even several of the Senate's early rules incorporated  unanimous consent provisions to speed the Senate's routine business.</p>
    <p>Two types of unanimous consent are prevalent in today's Senate. Simple  unanimous consent requests deal with noncontroversial matters, such as Senators  asking unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of amendments. Complex  unanimous consent agreements establish a tailor-made procedure for considering  virtually any kind of business that the Senate takes up. They are commonly  brokered by the parties' floor leaders and managers. Two fundamental objectives  of these accords are to limit debate and to structure the amendment process. As  two Senate parliamentarians wrote in the Senate's volume of precedents: "Whereas  Senate Rules permit virtually unlimited debate, and very few restrictions on the  right to offer amendments, these [unanimous consent] agreements usually limit  debate and the right of Senators to offer amendments."</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>If the Founding Fathers visited the modern Senate, they would find that most  of their fundamental principles continue to guide its legislative process. The  direct election of Senators is probably the most significant constitutional  change to their handiwork. On the other hand, the "changing Senate" might  surprise some of the Framers. Senators, for example, typically attract large  media attention, especially compared to most House members. One result is that  the Senate has been an "incubator" for presidential contenders. The practice of  "holds" (requests by Senators to party leaders to delay floor consideration of  legislation or nominations), which is nowhere recognized in Senate rules or  precedents and about which little is known with respect to its origins, has  become a prominent feature of today's Senate. Despite these and many other  developments, the Senate remains the preeminent legislative forum for protecting  political minorities and debating and refining the great issues of the  day.</p>

    <div class="standardBox" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="boxTitle">Committee Organization and  Procedure</span></strong></span></div>
    <div class="standardBox"><span class="boxTitle"><br /></span></div>
    <div class="standardBox">
    <p>Committees in the Senate have the power to conduct hearings and  investigations, to draft bills and resolutions (and amendments to them), to  report legislation to the Senate for its possible consideration, and to conduct  oversight of the executive branch. Senate committees also have the power to  originate legislation. Additionally, Senate committees consider treaties and  nominations in the course of the Senate's exercise of its constitutional  authority of "advice and consent."</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Organization</strong></p>
    <p>Committee Assignments. Committee assignments serve an important purpose in  each Senator's pursuit of legislative, representational, and other goals. They  are also important to party leaders who organize and shape the composition of  the committees. Senate rules prescribe the size of each committee. Committee  party ratios generally reflect party strength in the chamber. Adjustments to  committee size and ratio often result from interparty negotiations before each  Congress. Senate rules specify certain procedures for making committee  assignments. The rules of the party conferences supplement the Senate rules,  providing more specific criteria for making committee assignments.</p>
    <p>Senate rules categorize standing and other committees for the purpose of  distributing committee assignments to Senators. Essentially, each Senator is  limited to service on two "A" committees, and on one "B" committee. Assignment  to "C" committees is unrestricted. Party rules also restrict Senators' service  on so-called "Super A" committees. Additionally, these service rules may be  waived individually or collectively, as the Senate (and its parties) think  necessary.</p>
    <p>Jurisdiction and Referral. Committee jurisdiction is determined by Senate  rules, supplemented by formal agreements among committees and precedents  established by prior referrals. Senate Rule XXV identifies the policy topics  handled by each standing committee. The formal responsibility for referral rests  with the presiding officer of the Senate, but in practice the Senate  parliamentarian advises on bill referrals. Measures are generally referred to a  single committee based on "the subject matter which predominates." By unanimous  consent, the Senate permits multiple referrals, either joint or sequential, for  measures that cross jurisdictional boundaries. Multiple referral may also be  accomplished by motion of the joint party leaders, although it appears that this  motion has never been used.</p>
    <p>Subcommittees. A subcommittee is a subunit of a committee established for the  purpose of dividing and managing a committee's work. Unlike the House, the  Senate places no direct limits on the number of subcommittees that a committee  may create, and there are no requirements to create any subcommittees.</p>
    <p>However, both Senate and Republican Conference rules limit the number of  subcommittee assignments per Senator. Under Senate Rule XXV, a Senator may sit  on no more than three subcommittees on each of his class "A" committee  assignments, and on no more than two subcommittees on a class "B" committee. A  Senate standing order also encourages Senate committees to adopt rules for  equitable assignment of Senators to subcommittees. Several committees have  adopted such provisions, which prohibit a Senator's assignment to a second  subcommittee until all committee members have chosen one assignment in the order  of their seniority. As with full committee assignment limits, subcommittee  assignment limits can be waived.</p>
    <p>Committee Rules. As agents of the Senate, committees must comply with all  applicable Senate directives. Most of these requirements appear in Senate Rule  XXVI. Each Senate committee must adopt (and publish in the Congressional  Record), written rules to govern its proceedings "not inconsistent with the  Rules of the Senate." These committee rules generally dictate the procedures a  committee follows in conducting its business. For example, committees must  select a regular meeting day, which must be at least monthly, and determine  appropriate quorums for various committee actions within the limits of Senate  rules.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Hearings</strong></p>
    <p>Committees use hearings to gather information for use in legislative,  oversight and investigative activities, and to review the qualifications of  presidential nominees. Regardless of the type of hearing, or whether a hearing  is held in Washington or elsewhere, hearings share common aspects of planning  and preparation. Senate standing committees and subcommittees are authorized to  meet and to hold hearings when the Senate is in session, and when it has  recessed or adjourned. To minimize conflicts with floor activities, a committee  may not meet, without unanimous consent, on any day after the Senate has been in  session for two hours, or after 2:00 p.m. when the Senate is in session.</p>
    <p>Senate Rule XXVI requires each committee (except Appropriations and Budget)  to give at least one week's notice of the date, place, and subject of a hearing;  however, a committee may hold a hearing with less than one week's notice if it  determines that there is "good cause." These notices appear in the Daily Digest  section of the Congressional Record. While the Senate rule requires a one week  public notice, a separate standing order of the Senate requires each Senate  committee to notify the Daily Digest Office as soon as a hearing is scheduled  [S.Res. 4, 95th Congress]. Hearings are generally open to the public, but can be  closed by a committee roll-call vote in open session if the subject matter falls  within specific categories enumerated in Senate rules.</p>
    <p>Although a committee chair determines the agenda and selects witnesses, the  minority typically works informally with the majority to invite witnesses  representing its views. Senate rules allow the minority-party members of a  committee (except Appropriations) to call witnesses of their choice on at least  one day of a hearing. Witnesses before Senate committees generally must provide  the committee with a copy of their written testimony at least one day before  their oral testimony, with specifics set out in individual committee rules. It  is common practice to request witnesses to limit their oral remarks to a brief  summary of the written testimony.</p>
    <p>A question-and-answer period generally follows a witness's testimony. Each  committee determines the order in which Senators question witnesses. Although  Senate rules do not restrict the length of time each Senator may question a  witness, several committees have adopted such rules. Some committees also  authorize committee staff to question witnesses.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Markup</strong></p>
    <p>A markup is a meeting of the committee to debate and consider amendments to a  measure under consideration. The markup determines whether the measure pending  before a committee will be recommended to the full Senate, and whether it should  be amended in any substantive way.</p>
    <p>Procedures in markup for the most part reflect procedures used on the Senate  floor, possibly modified by an individual committee's rules. The process begins  when the chair of the committee schedules and sets the agenda for the markup. In  leading a markup, the chair has broad discretion choosing the legislative  vehicle and presenting it for consideration and amendment. The measure that is  marked up may be one that was introduced in the Senate, or received from the  House and referred to the committee. Alternatively the chair may choose to  consider the text of a draft measure that has not been introduced, such as a  subcommittee-reported version or a chairman's mark. In still other cases, the  markup vehicle may be placed before the committee as an "amendment in the nature  of a substitute" for the measure or text initially referred to it.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Reporting Legislation</strong></p>
    <p>When a committee concludes its markup, any committee member may move to order  the measure reported to the Senate. A committee has several options for the form  in which the a measure is ordered reported. It may be reported with no changes,  with amendments to various sections adopted in markup, or with one amendment in  the nature of a substitute. In addition, a Senate committee is authorized to  report an original bill that embodies a text decided upon in markup.</p>
    <p>Senate rules require the physical presence of a majority of the committee in  order to report a measure. Absent Senators may vote by proxy on reporting a  measure unless a committee has adopted a rule to the contrary, but such proxy  votes may not effect the outcome of a vote to report a measure, and proxies may  not be counted to determine a quorum.</p>
    <p>Following a committee's vote to order a measure reported, it is the duty of  the committee's chairman to report the measure promptly to the Senate. When a  committee reports a measure, it generally prepares an accompanying written  report that describes the purposes and provisions of the measure. If a report is  submitted, Senate rules and statutes require the inclusion of such components as  records of roll-call votes cast in committee, cost estimates, a statement of  regulatory impact, and the specific changes the legislation would make to  existing law. Committee members are also entitled to at least three days to  prepare supplementary, minority, or additional views for inclusion in the  report.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Hearings</strong></p>
    <p>Printed hearings contain the edited transcript of testimony, but they are  often not published for months after a hearing. Hearing transcripts are usually  available for inspection in committee offices and are often posted online.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Reports on Measures</strong></p>
    <p>A committee report accompanying legislation, described above, provides an  explanation of a measure, and the committee's actions in considering it.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Calendars</strong></p>
    <p>Committee calendars are comprehensive records of a committee's actions,  including committee rules, membership, brief legislative histories of measures  referred to the committee, lists of hearings and markups held, and often a list  of committee publications. Calendars are published at the end of each  Congress.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Committee Prints</strong></p>
    <p>Finally, committees may also publish other information as "committee prints."  A committee print might include committee rules or a report on a policy issue  the committee wants to distribute widely, but in a form which is less formal  than a committee report. A committee may also prepare a text which the Senate  (by resolution) orders printed as a numbered Senate document.</p>

    <div class="standardBox" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="boxTitle">Senate Floor Procedure</span></span></strong></div>
    <div class="standardBox"><span class="boxTitle"><br /></span></div>
    <div class="standardBox">
    <p class="title"><strong>Senate Proceedings and Senators' Rights</strong></p>
    <p>Senate floor proceedings are governed not only by the Senate's standing rules  and precedents, but by various customary practices. Generally, these practices  expedite business, but require unanimous consent.</p>
    <p>Senate rules and practices emphasize full deliberation more than expeditious  decision, and rights of individual Senators more than the powers of the  majority. Senators can protect their rights by objecting to unanimous consent  requests to waive rules. Compromise and accommodation tend to prevail; Senators  most often insist on strict enforcement of rules in contentious situations.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Debate, Filibusters, and Cloture</strong></p>
    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate may not use the power to recognize  Senators to control the flow of business. If no Senator holds the floor, any  Senator seeking recognition has a right to be recognized, and then, usually, to  speak for as long as he or she wishes (but only twice a day on the same  question). Once recognized, a Senator can move to call up any measure or offer  any amendment or motion that is in order. Senate rules do not permit a majority  to end debate and vote on a pending question.</p>
    <p>Generally, no debatable question can come to a vote if Senators still wish to  speak. Senators who oppose a pending bill or other matter may speak against it  at indefinite length, or delay action by offering numerous amendments and  motions. A filibuster involves using such tactics in the hope of convincing the  Senate to alter a measure or withdraw it from consideration. The only bills that  cannot be filibustered are those few considered under provisions of law that  limit time for debating them.</p>
    <p>The only procedure Senate rules provide for overcoming filibusters is  cloture, which cannot be voted until two days after it is proposed in a petition  signed by 16 Senators. Cloture requires the support of three-fifths of Senators  (normally 60), except on proposals to change the rules, when cloture requires  two-thirds of Senators voting. If the Senate invokes cloture on a bill,  amendment, or other matter, its further consideration is limited to 30  additional hours, including time consumed by votes and quorum calls, during  which each Senator may speak for no more than one hour.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Scheduling Legislative Business</strong></p>
    <p>Senate business includes legislative business (bills and resolutions) and  executive business (nominations and treaties). (The Senate also sits as a court  to try impeachments, for which a special, separate set of rules applies.) When  introduced or received from the House or the President, legislative or executive  business is normally referred to the committee with appropriate jurisdiction.  Business is placed on the legislative or executive calendar, and becomes  available for floor consideration, if the committee reports it.</p>
    <p>The Senate accords its majority leader prime responsibility for scheduling.  He may carry out this responsibility by moving that the Senate proceed to  consider a particular matter. By precedent, he and the minority leader are  recognized preferentially, and by custom only he (or his designee) makes motions  or requests affecting when the Senate will meet and what it will consider.</p>
    <p>For executive business, this motion to proceed may be offered in a  nondebatable form, but for legislative business it usually is debatable.  Whenever possible, therefore, the majority leader instead calls up bills and  resolutions by unanimous consent. If Senators object to unanimous consent to  take up a measure, they are implicitly threatening to filibuster a motion to  consider it. They may do so because they oppose that measure, or in the hope of  influencing action on some other matter.</p>
    <p>Senators can even place a "hold" on a measure or nomination, although this  practice is not recognized in Senate rules. "Holds" are requests by Senators to  their party's floor leader to object on their behalf to any request to consider  a matter, at least until they have been consulted. The majority leader will  usually not even request consent to consider a measure if there is a hold on  it.</p>
    <p>Senate rules also permit a measure to be placed directly on the calendar when  introduced or received from the House. This process permits Senators to bypass  referral to a committee they believe unsympathetic. Alternatively, if a  committee fails to report a measure, a new measure with exactly the same  provisions may be introduced and placed directly on the calendar.</p>
    <p>Finally, Senate rules do not require that amendments be germane or relevant,  except to general appropriation bills, budget measures, and matters under  cloture (and a few other bills, pursuant to statutes). Consequently, if a  committee fails to report a measure, a Senator may offer its text as an  amendment to any other measure under consideration, without regard to the  scheduling preferences of the majority leader.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>The Daily Order of Business</strong></p>
    <p>Each time the Senate convenes after an adjournment, a new legislative day  begins. On each new legislative day, Senate rules provide for a "Morning Hour"  during which routine "morning business" can occur, such as introducing bills and  submitting committee reports. During this period, the Senate may also be able to  take up bills on the calendar by nondebatable motions.</p>
    <p>In practice, the Senate often recesses at the end of the day, rather than  adjourning. Party leaders sometimes prefer a recess because it gives them  greater flexibility in shaping the Senate's daily business. Since there is then  no Morning Hour when the Senate next convenes, the majority leader usually  obtains unanimous consent for "a period for routine morning business," such as  bill introductions. Senators often make brief speeches during this period.</p>
    <p>After the Morning Hour or the period for routine morning business, the Senate  normally resumes consideration of the business previously before it. This  business may be set aside, temporarily or indefinitely, in favor of other  business through motions or unanimous consent requests by the majority leader.  At any point in the day, noncontroversial business also may be conducted by  unanimous consent.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Unanimous Consent Agreements</strong></p>
    <p>Senators' rights to debate and to offer nongermane amendments encourage the  leaders to seek unanimous consent agreements that limit the exercise of these  rights during consideration of a specified matter. If any Senator objects, the  Senate cannot impose such an agreement, but once it is accepted, the Senate may  later change its terms only by unanimous consent.</p>
    <p>Unanimous consent agreements limiting the time for debate on a measure are  frequently called "time agreements." Time agreements impose stated limits on  debate of questions that may arise during consideration of a measure, and often  on the legislation itself. These agreements place the time provided under the  control of managers. Other Senators then may speak only if a manager yields them  part of the time he or she controls.</p>
    <p>Unanimous consent agreements also may require that amendments to a measure be  germane, or, alternatively, relevant to it. Relevancy is a somewhat less  restrictive standard than germaneness. An agreement may prohibit all amendments  to a measure except those it specifically identifies.</p>
    <p>Responsibility for negotiating time agreements falls primarily on the party  floor leaders and the leaders of the reporting committee. Individual Senators  advise the leaders of their preferences and intentions, and time agreements may  include exceptions to their general provisions in order to satisfy these  preferences.</p>
    <p>The Senate begins consideration of most measures without first having reached  a time agreement. For some measures, few amendments and little debate are  expected, making an agreement unnecessary. For others, consideration may proceed  while the floor leaders and managers try to arrange unanimous consent agreements  for limited purposes. Before consideration of a controversial amendment, for  example, leaders may propose to limit debate on it. If extended consideration  occurs, the leaders often seek an overall agreement limiting debate on each  remaining amendment, or setting a time for a vote on final passage.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>The Amending Process</strong></p>
    <p>Floor consideration of a measure usually begins with opening statements by  the floor managers, and often by other Senators. The managers usually are the  chair and ranking minority member of the reporting committee or pertinent  subcommittee.</p>
    <p>The first amendments to be considered are those recommended by the reporting  committee. If the committee has proposed many amendments, the manager often  obtains unanimous consent that these amendments be adopted, but that all  provisions of the measure as amended remain open to further amendment. After  committee amendments are disposed of, amendments may be offered to any part of  the measure in any order. If the committee recommends a substitute for the full  text of the measure, the substitute normally remains open to amendment  throughout its consideration.</p>
    <p>The Senate may dispose of each amendment either by voting on it directly or  by voting to table it. The motion to table cannot be debated; and, if the Senate  agrees to it, the effect is the same as a vote to defeat the amendment. If the  Senate defeats the motion, however, debate on the amendment may resume.</p>
    <p>While an amendment is pending, Senators may propose amendments to it (called  second-degree amendments) and to the part of the measure the amendment would  change. The Senate votes on each of these amendments before it votes on the  first-degree amendment (the amendment to the measure). Many additional  complications exist. When a complete substitute for a measure is pending, for  example, Senators can propose six or more first- and second-degree amendments to  the substitute and the measure before any votes must occur.</p>
    <p>If an amendment is considered under a time limitation, Senators may make no  motions or points of order, or propose other amendments, until all the time for  debating the amendment has been used or yielded back. Sometimes, however, the  Senate unanimously consents to lay aside pending amendments temporarily in order  to consider another amendment to the measure.</p>
    <p>The amending process continues until the Senate orders the bill engrossed and  read a third time, which precludes further amendment. Then the Senate votes on  final passage.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Voting and Quorum Calls</strong></p>
    <p>The Constitution requires a majority of Senators to be present for the Senate  to conduct business. If a Senator suggests the absence of a quorum, and a  majority of Senators do not respond to their names, the Senate can only adjourn,  recess, or attempt to secure the attendance of additional Senators. However, the  purpose of a quorum call usually is to suspend floor activity temporarily to  accommodate individual Senators, discuss procedural or policy problems, or  arrange subsequent proceedings. As a result, quorum calls usually are ended by  unanimous consent before the clerk completes a call of the roll.</p>
    <p>Article. I, sec. 5, paragraph 3 of the Constitution provides that one-fifth  of those present (11 Senators, if no more than a quorum is present) can order  the yeas and nays -- also known as a rollcall vote or a recorded vote. If a  Senator asks for the yeas and nays on a pending question, and the Senate orders  them, it does not mean that a vote will occur immediately. Instead, ordering the  yeas and nays means that whenever the vote does occur, it will be by roll call  and will be recorded in the Journal. Otherwise, votes usually are taken by voice  vote.</p>

    <div class="standardBox" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="boxTitle">Resolving Differences with the  House</span></strong></span></div>
    <div class="standardBox"><span class="boxTitle"><br /></span></div>
    <div class="standardBox">
    <p>A bill cannot become a law of the land until it has been approved in  identical form by both houses of Congress. Once the Senate amends and agrees to  a bill that the House already has passed--or the House amends and passes a  Senate bill--the two houses may begin to resolve their legislative differences  by way of a conference committee or through an exchange of amendments between  the houses.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Conference Committees</strong></p>
    <p>If the Senate does not accept the House's position (or the House does not  agree to the Senate's position), one of the chambers may propose creation of a  conference committee to negotiate and resolve the matters in disagreement  between the two chambers. Typically, the Senate gets to conference with the  House by adopting this standard motion: "Mr. President, I move that the Senate  insist on its amendments (or "disagree to the House amendments" to the  Senate-passed measure), request a conference with the House on the disagreeing  votes thereon, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees." This  triple motion rolled into one?to insist (or disagree), request, and appoint?is  commonly agreed to by unanimous consent. The presiding officer formally appoints  the Senate's conferees. (The Speaker names the House conferees.) Conferees are  traditionally drawn from the committee of jurisdiction, but conferees  representing other Senate interests may also be appointed.</p>
    <p>There are no formal rules that outline how conference meetings are to be  organized. Routinely, the principals from each chamber or their respective  staffs conduct pre-conference meetings so as to expedite the bargaining process  when the conference formally convenes. Informal practice also determines who  will be the overall conference chair (each chamber has its own leader in  conference). Rotation of the chairmanship between the chambers is usually the  practice when matched pairs of panels (the tax or appropriations panels, for  example) convene in conference regularly. For standing committees that seldom  meet in conference, the choice of who will chair the conference is generally  resolved by the conference leaders from each chamber. The decision on when and  where to meet and for how long are a few prerogatives of the chair, who consults  on these matters with his or her counterpart from the other body.</p>
    <p>Once the two chambers go to conference, the respective House and Senate  conferees bargain and negotiate to resolve the matters in bicameral  disagreement. Resolution is embodied in a conference report, signed by a  majority of Senate conferees and House conferees. The conference report must be  agreed to by both chambers before it is cleared for presidential consideration.  In the Senate, conference reports are usually brought up by unanimous consent at  a time agreed to by the party leaders and floor managers. Because conference  reports are privileged, if any Senator objects to the unanimous consent request,  a nondebatable motion can be made to take up the conference report. Approval of  the conference report itself is subject to extended debate, but conference  reports are not open to amendment.</p>
    <p>Almost all of the most important measures are sent to conference, but these  are only a minority of the bills that the two houses pass each year.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Exchange of Amendments between the Houses</strong></p>
    <p>Differences between versions of most noncontroversial bills and some major  bills that must be passed quickly are reconciled through the exchange of  amendments between the houses. The two chambers may send measures back and  forth, amending each other's amendments until they agree to identical language  on all provisions of the legislation. Generally, the provisions of an amendment  between the houses are the subject of informal negotiations, so extended  exchanges of amendments are rare. But there is also a parliamentary limit on the  number of times a measure may shuttle between the chambers. In general, each  chamber has only two opportunities to amend the amendments of the other body  because both chambers prohibit third-degree amendments. In rare instances,  however, the two chambers waive or disregard the parliamentary limit and  exchange amendments more than twice. The current record is nine exchanges.</p>
    <p>At any stage of this process a chamber may accept the position of the other  body, insist on its most recent position, request a conference to resolve the  remaining differences, or refuse to take further action and allow the measure to  die.</p>
    <p>The Senate normally takes action on an amendment of the House only when there  is an expectation that the amendment may be disposed of readily, typically by  unanimous consent. In the absence of such an expectation, the Senate will  generally proceed to conference in order to negotiate a resolution to any  serious disagreements within the Senate or with the House rather than attempt to  resolve them on the floor.</p>
    <p class="title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Enrollment</strong></span></p>
    <p>The Senate and House must resolve all their disagreements concerning a bill  or joint resolution before it can be "enrolled" and presented to the President  for his approval or veto. When the measure has finally been approved by both  houses, all the original papers are transmitted to the enrolling clerk of the  originating chamber.</p>
    </div>
    <p><a name="Enrollment_and_Presidential_Action"></a></p>
    <div class="standardBox">
    <p>After the Senate and House resolve all their disagreements concerning a bill  or joint resolution, all the original papers are transmitted to the enrolling  clerk of the originating chamber, who has the measure printed on parchment,  certified by the chief officer of the originating chamber, and signed by the  Speaker of the House and by either the Vice President (who is the President of  the Senate) or the authorized presiding officer of the Senate. The enrolled bill  then goes to the President for his approval or veto.</p>
    <p>Measures are not always presented immediately to the President. A variety of  factors can produce delays. When the President has been out of the country for  long periods of time, for example, the White House and congressional leaders  have agreed that enrolled measures will be presented to the President upon his  return; at other times, measures have been sent to the President overseas. In  other instances, congressional leaders present measures so as to give time for  organizing public signing ceremonies or so the signing to take place on a  particular day. In still other instances, depending on whether the President is  expected to sign or veto a measure, congressional leaders time the presentation  to avoid or to bring political pressure to bear on the President.</p>
    <p class="title"><strong>Presidential Action</strong></p>
    <p>Pursuant to Article 1, section 7 of the Constitution, "Every Bill, which  shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it  become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; . . . ." If  the President approves and signs the measure within 10 days, it becomes law. The  10-day period begins on midnight of the day the President receives the measure,  and Sundays are not counted. Thus, if the President were to receive an enrolled  measure on Thursday, February 14th, the first day of the 10-day period would be  Friday, February 15th; the last day would be Tuesday, February 26th.</p>
    <p>If the President objects to a measure, he may veto it by returning it to its  chamber of origin together with a statement of his objections, again within the  same 10-day period. Unless both chambers subsequently vote by a 2/3 majority to  override the veto, the measure does not become law.</p>
    <p>If the President does not act on a measure--approving or vetoing it--within  10 days, the fate of the measure depends on whether Congress is in session. If  Congress is in session, the bill becomes law without the President's approval.  If Congress is not in session, the measure does not become law. Presidential  inaction when Congress is not in session is known as a pocket veto. Congress has  interpreted the use of the pocket veto to be limited to the final, so-called  sine die adjournment of the originating chamber. The President's pocket veto  authority is not definitively decided.</p>

  content: |-
    <p><strong>Rules Matter!</strong></p>
    <p>Legislators who know the rules and how to apply them will find that they have  more opportunities to advance their policy ideas. Rules are important because  they are not neutral. They promote a particular form of decision-making that  sometimes advantages particular interests or policies. A simple example is the  rule that states that a tie vote defeats a motion. Why should a tie lead to a  defeat? This rule advances a conservative view of the legislative process, where  stability is valued over change.</p>
    <p><strong>Where to Find these Rules</strong></p>
    <p>LegSim provides an abbreviated set of rules that closely approximate those of  the legislature you are simulating. Additional information about proper  procedure can be found on the website of the legislature in question. For the  House of Representatives, for example, you can consult the <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/legisAct/legisProc/rules/index.html">actual  rules of the House</a> or additional&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/">information&nbsp;made available by the House  Rules Committee</a>. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee is where to  go for information about <a href="http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Rules_and_Procedure_vrd.htm">Senate  Rules and Procedure</a>.</p>
    <p>There are also&nbsp;excellent books that explain how the rules are normally  applied in the House and Senate, such as&nbsp;Walter Oleszek, <em>Congressional  Procedures and the Policy Process</em> (Washington D.C.: Congressional Quarterly  Press) and Charles Tiefer, <em>Congressional Procedures and Practice</em> (Connecticut: Greenwood Press). Many students also rely on Roberts&rsquo; Rules, but  the rules of Congress do not always correspond!</p>
    <p><strong>The (Super)Majoritarian Principle</strong></p>
    <p>You will encounter situations where the rules do not offer a simple answer.  You will also encounter situations where you would rather ignore the rules in  order to get your policy passed! Just remember that the rules exist for a  reason. Although those purposes may not always be relevant to the situation at  hand, your simulation will be more realistic if&nbsp;you&nbsp;apply the rules as if these  longer term purposes&nbsp;are important.</p>
    <p>That said, the Constitution gives Congress broad authority to determine its  own rules. Each chamber sets its own rules by majority rule&nbsp;and the rules  themselves offer opportunities for circumventing certain procedures (again by  majority rule). However, the possibility of&nbsp; a filibuster sets a higher bar (60  votes are needed to overcome&nbsp;one) for altering Senate procedures in a  significant way..&nbsp;But given sufficient support, even the rules that make a  filibuster possible&nbsp;could be altered by the Senate.</p>
    <p><strong>Be Faithful</strong></p>
    <p>In the House, almost any rule can be &ldquo;waived&rdquo; by a simple majority vote, but  only if the motion to waive it takes the form of a special rule first proposed  by the Rules Committee. Otherwise, it would&nbsp;be cheating&nbsp;to decide&nbsp;by majority  rule that the House was going to ignore an&nbsp;established procedure!&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice,  these types of procedural changes tend to be concentrated in the resolution  establishing the rules at the beginning of each new Congress.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="clearfix pad">
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How your legislature&nbsp;differs from the U.S.  Congress</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Not a Bicameral Process</strong></p>
    <p>The most important difference between the U.S. lawmaking process and your  LegSimlature is that yours probably does not have a companion chamber that must  also pass a bill in identical form before it can become law.</p>
    <p><strong>No Committee of the Whole</strong></p>
    <p>In addition,&nbsp;the House of Representatives makes many of its decisions under a  procedure known as the &ldquo;Committee of the Whole&rdquo; (COW). The COW is a procedural  convenience. It allows the legislature to conduct much of its business&nbsp;with less  than a majority of members present. LegSim does not include a Committee of the  Whole procedure.</p>
    <p><strong>No built in Authorizations/Appropriations Distinction</strong></p>
    <p>The U.S. Congress also has two separate lawmaking processes - authorizations  and appropriations. Authorizing laws give the government legal&nbsp;authority to do  things (e.g. regulate prescription drugs). However, the funds needed to&nbsp;pay for  new and existing programs are provided through&nbsp;appropriations laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Whereas authorizing laws can create permanent programs or programs that must  be reauthorized in a few years,&nbsp; the funds needed to pay for many&nbsp;programs must  be appropriated annually (there are important exceptions, such as many  entitlement programs). Finally, to make things even more confusing, some  programs are authorized but not funded, and sometimes funds are appropriated for  purposes that are not authorized!</p>
    <p><strong>No Budget Process</strong></p>
    <p>Congress also adopts budgeting procedures designed to promote greater fiscal  discipline. Each spring, the Congress passes a budget &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; that  specifies overall spending targets in major categories of spending (e.g.  defense, interior, agriculture). The subcommittees of the appropriations  committee then propose spending levels for specific programs and activities. The  budget &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; then resolves any lingering discrepancies between the  resolution and what the appropriations committee has proposed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Budget agreements do not pertain to entitlement programs (like Social  Security) where the law requires the government to provide (and pay for) a  service to anyone whomeets the eligibility requirements.&nbsp;Second, budget  agreements do not apply to &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; appropriations, and what constitutes an  emergency is up to the&nbsp;Congress!</p>
    <p><strong>No Status Quo Policy</strong></p>
    <p>Most of the proposals Congress debates would revise&nbsp;existing law. For  example, a health care reform bill proposes to alter existing regulations rather  than proposing health care regulations for the first time. It is obviously  difficult for students to get up to speed on complex subjects in such a short  time so this is one area where realism may take a hit. Nevertheless we think  that it is best for everyone to have students developing proposals that reflect  an awareness of existing law.</p>
    <p>We also suggest that students estimate the costs of the programs&nbsp;they  propose.&nbsp;The committee responsible for reviewing the bill should also&nbsp;make an  assessment of&nbsp;whether those costs seem&nbsp;realistic.&nbsp;To introduce a budget  constraint, one option is to assume that&nbsp;passing a&nbsp;bill that costs&nbsp;$10 billion  means that the government is now runing a&nbsp;deficit. To keep the&nbsp;budget in  balance, other programs would need to be cut, and/or additional revenues raised.  Of course, the legislature might&nbsp;also choose to have a deficit.</p>
    <p><strong>No Reauthorizations</strong></p>
    <p>Finally,&nbsp;because Congress authorizes many new programs for&nbsp;limited time  periods, those programs must be reviewed and reauthorized. As a result,&nbsp;the real  Congress (and especially its committees) have less discretion than is true for  your legislature.</p>

  title: How a Filibuster Works in LegSim
  content: |-
    <p>When a committee reports a bill, the Majority Leader places it on the  appropriate Calendar for possible floor consideration.</p>
    <p>At that point in time, Senators can place Holds (under Clerk) to indicate  that they have reservations about bringing the bill to the floor. ** In LegSim a  senator cannot filibuster a bill unless s/he has placed a hold before the bill  is voted on.**</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How a Filibuster works in LegSim</span></strong></p>
    <p>1. The moment a bill is placed on the calendar any member can register a  <strong>Hold</strong> on the bill (in the Senate this is a Notice of Intent to  Object to Proceeding.<strong><em> </em></strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>In  LegSim, a hold is placed by going to <strong>Clerk -&gt; Legislative  Holds</strong>. Members can both add and remove a hold from this  interface.<br /><br />2. The Majority Leader can then propose a floor procedure.  Now, LegSim won't enforce this rule, but if the Majority Leader proposes a floor  procedure too quickly, then members won't have a chance to register holds...  which you'll see is important here in a moment. Floor procedures come in one of  two types<br /><br />&nbsp;-<strong> Unanimous Consent Agreements</strong>: requires zero  'no' votes, but cannot be filibustered<br />&nbsp;- <strong>Motion to Proceed</strong>:  requires simple majority, can be filibustered<br /><br />The system will provide a  draft motion based on which of the two types of procedure the majority leader  selects, but the Majority Leader can/should revise the motion to specify the  proposed procedures for the consideration of the bill. <br /><br />3. Once the  motion is scheduled, anyone who has registered a hold -- BEFORE the motion to  proceed was scheduled -- can initiate a filibuster by selecting the  '<strong>still debating</strong>' option. The vote clock then stops and  <strong>no voting</strong> on that bill is<strong> </strong>allowed until either  the filibuster ends or <strong>cloture</strong> is achieved. The vote clock  starts only if all filibuster-ers withdraw, OR...<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The Majority Leader  schedules a cloture vote and the cloture vote passes. Cloture votes require a  3/5ths majority and count "present" votes as "no" votes. They cannot be  filibustered. If the cloture motion is adopted, the vote clock will start again  (on whatever vote is pending).<br /><br />5. If the motion to proceed is adopted,  the legislation in question can now be scheduled for amendment or final passage  votes. Final passage votes are subject to filibusters using the same process  described above. However, if the motion to proceed limits debate then the  chamber leader should schedule the final passage vote so that it cannot be  filibustered.</p>

  title: Member Tutorial
  content: <p><a href="http://youtu.be/jtDUNcZDnOE" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/video-camera.png" alt="Member Video Tutorial"></a></p><p>LegSim is your legislature. Your job is to represent your constituency and  advance your policy views. You and your classmates will choose your leaders and  organize your committees. You will then draft bills, evaluate and decide the  fate of bills as committee members, and vote on those that make it to the floor.  This may seem straightforward but it is complicated by the fact that there will  inevitably not be enough time to give every proposal the attention it deserves,  and by the fact that there will be disagreements about which proposals should  have priority. There will be winners and losers in this process!<br /><br />An  effective legislator understands the legislative process. A bill must pass  certain hurdles to become law. But there are also different ways to get past  these hurdles. It&rsquo;s important to know the rules, the issue, and to see those  issues from the political perspectives of your colleagues.<br /><br />Legislatures  have norms of behavior in addition to rules of procedure. In debate, members  refer to one another as representatives (for example, the "distinguished  representative of Colorado"). This non-personal way of addressing colleagues  reminds them that the views being expressed are part of a representational  process. Personal attacks during debate are not appropriate and can lead to  censure.<br /><br />You may be tempted to take things personally in your  &ldquo;simulation.&rdquo; Decisions produce winners and losers, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel good to  be on the losing side. But in the heat of the moment, it is worth remembering  that it is not usually a good strategy to burn your bridges. Once you send that  e-mail, it is impossible to take back.<br /><br />AN OVERVIEW OF THE  PROCESS<br /><br />To give you a better sense of what is coming, this tutorial  describes a bit about each major stage of your simulation. The other tutorials  on the LegSim website provide the more specific information you will need along  the way. And if you have a question or a suggestion, you can contact us at  helpdesk@legsim.org.<br /><br />The four stages are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizing the  legislature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Introductions and cosponsorship<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee  deliberation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Floor action and enactment<br /><br />Your instructor will  probably ask you to complete certain tasks by specified dates. This is to ensure  that each student has taken the needed steps to allow this collective activity  to proceed.<br /><br />1. ORGANIZING THE LEGISLATURE<br /><br />Member  profile<br /><br />You have probably already begun to create your member profile.  The 'edit profile' option under the &lsquo;members&rsquo; link on the sidebar is where you  make additional changes (you can also change your password). Every bill that you  sponsor or cosponsor, every vote that you cast (etc.) will be automatically  archived here, as well as any assignments you have been asked to  complete.<br /><br />Your instructor will provide information about how to select a  constituency, and how to research it in order to answer the question posed on  your profile page.<br /><br />Providing a valid e-mail address is essential and you  should confirm that you are receiving mail sent through the LegSim system. To  find out whether any mail has been sent to you, check your mailbox under the  &lsquo;members&rsquo; link. If there is mail there but you haven't received any to your  email address, you may want to check your junk mailbox on your personal email  account. If you see LegSim email there, there is usually an option to - accept  mail from this address.<br /><br />Other legislators will study your profile to find  out more about you, your political interests, and the constituency you  represent. Thus the profile is is an important for establishing the  relationships that will help you to advance your policy  priorities.<br /><br />Requesting and assigning committee positions<br /><br />One of  the goals of LegSim is to draw attention to the importance of organizations and  rules in legislatures. Every bill that is introduced is first considered by a  smaller committee of legislators. Committees are a means of dividing the  workload, but because they are smaller they also give committee members greater  influence over how certain issues develop. You can indicate your committee  preferences using the 'request assignment" option under the &lsquo;committees&rsquo; link.  While you are at it, be sure to check out the individual committees to learn  more about the issues they manage.<br /><br />The legislature as a whole decides how  to allocate committee assignments, including the number of committee positions  and who will serve in those positions. In the real world, the parties usually  control this process (some state legislatures have different practices). But  LegSim leaves these decisions up to each class. Given the important of  committees in the process, it is worth a little of your time to think about how  you would like these selections to be made!<br /><br />Forming caucuses<br /><br />A  caucus is an informal group that members create to advance a shared interest.  Most legislatures have party caucuses (e.g. Democrats), but they will often have  many more (e.g. the Congressional Hispanic caucus and the Kidney Disease  caucus).<br /><br />Any member can create a caucus. Go to the 'form caucus' option  under the 'committees' link. Once your caucus has been created, other members  can 'request' to join, but only the member who created can admit new members.  The same applies to political parties. You can request, but cannot join a party  without the party leader&rsquo;s consent (although where party membership is required,  the instructor may control this process).<br /><br />Selecting leaders<br /><br />Your  legislature needs leaders to manage the legislative process, from formally  assigning members to committees, to referring bills to the appropriate  committees, to scheduling floor votes. The chamber and committee leaders have  special levels of access to LegSim that allow them to perform these  tasks.<br /><br />If success is important, leader selection decisions are critically  important. Leader have more control over the agenda and hence more power. A  leader who manages the agenda efficiently benefits everyone. An efficient  organization means that responsibilities must be divided and that those  responsible are held accountable for their actions (or inaction).<br /><br />But  leadership is also a human endeavor. A leader needs to care about the interests  of those s/he represents, but must also be willing to make the difficult (and  often unpopular) decisions necessary to advance collective goals.<br /><br />Most  schools will leave it to the membership to select their leaders (in some classes  the instructor may assume this role, due to time constraints for example).  Choosing a single leader from a pool of candidates (assuming there are more than  two nominees) is not straightforward. If, for example, there are 5 candidates,  is getting the most votes sufficient, or should a leader receive a majority of  the votes? Should this process be secret or open? If your legislature has  parties, will the parties first try to agree on a candidate before the  legislature as a whole decides?<br /><br />Committee leaders have primarily  responsibility for getting the committee&rsquo;s work done (and like real committee  leaders, they may discover that not every other committee member is as eager to  see the work of the committee completed!).<br /><br />2. BILL INTRODUCTION AND  COSPONSORSHIP<br /><br />Introducing a bill<br /><br />Introducing a bill is easy.  You&rsquo;ll find the &lsquo;submit a bill&rsquo; option under the 'floor' link on the sidebar.  Your bill is assigned a number and is posted to the website as soon as you click  &lsquo;submit.&rsquo; From there, it is automatically sent to the chamber leader&rsquo;s desk, who  than has 24 hours to refer it the appropriate committee or  committees.<br /><br />Whether your bill progresses beyond this stage is much less  certain. (In the U.S. Congress, 8 out of 10 bills fail to make it beyond  committee referral.) In most classes, students will be encouraged to draft bills  on subjects of their choosing (although in some classes, the choices will be  constrained by a different process (e.g. EU:LegSim), or by the instructor&rsquo;s  desire to limit attention on one policy area.<br /><br />No one is expecting you to  be a policy expert from the start. Your instructor should point you to resources  that will help you get up to speed on your subject. In addition, there is a  &lsquo;sample bill' located under the 'Instruction' link on the LegSim website to give  you a better sense of how a bill is organized.<br /><br />No one enjoys criticism,  but if your goal is to be successful, then it may be a good idea to &lsquo;shop&rsquo; your  idea around a little before you actually submit it in the form of a bill. A bill  that has been submitted can&rsquo;t be edited, except through amendments if it ever  reaches the floor. Thus, it&rsquo;s a good idea to draft your bill in a document  program such as Microsoft Word. Give yourself a little time to think about what  you have written and how to improve it, and then double-check before you click  &lsquo;submit!!<br /><br />Soliciting cosponsors<br /><br />Your colleagues will probably not  support a bill they know little about. In most classes, a lot of bills will be  introduced, but most students will not check the website daily for the new  arrivals. For this reason, it&rsquo;s a good idea to promote awareness of your  legislation. The &lsquo;dear colleague&rsquo; letter (&lsquo;send a letter&rsquo; under the &lsquo;members&rsquo;  link) was designed exactly for this purpose. It is an easy way to grab the  attention of busy legislators, if only for a moment. Use the subject line to  highlight your bill&rsquo;s main attraction. Keep the letter short and to the point.  Why should other legislators care about your bill, among the many that have been  introduced? Do you want them to act, and if so how?<br /><br />One possible action  is cosponsorship. A bill that seems to have widespread support may be more  likely to receive attention in committee or on the floor. Cosponsorship also  helps you to identify potential allies.<br /><br />Why should you consider  cosponsoring? In addition to lending your support to a bill, cosponsorship is a  visible action (like sponsoring a bill) that sends a signal about your  priorities to your constituents. To cosponsor, find the bill and click on the  link at the bottom of the page. Bills can be cosponsored until they are reported  from committee and placed on a floor calendar.<br /><br />3. COMMITTEE  DELIBERATIONS<br /><br />A list of committees can be found under the &lsquo;committees&rsquo;  link on the sidebar. As a committee member, your organizational role is to help  the legislature decide priorities, and to improve the quality of the proposals  it considers. The importance of committees is demonstrated by the fact that  although very few bills fail once they reach the floor most if not all  legislatures, a very large proportion of bills never makes it that  far.<br /><br />At a more personal level, committees are in a position to exercise  agenda control in ways that serve the interests of committee members. In the  U.S. Congress, for example, about 80 percent of all bills reported to the  chamber by committees are sponsored by committee members.<br /><br />In considering  a bill, the essential questions that must be answered by the committee  are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we want to hold a hearing on this bill or ignore it?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do we want to recommend this bill to the legislature?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we want to  propose changes to the bill?<br /><br />The committee chair controls the website  tools, but the chair acts with the consent of the committee majority. As a  committee member, you have the right to participate in decisions about which  bills will be scheduled for hearings; to propose committee amendments; and to  decide whether a bill will be reported to the chamber. The chair formally  reports the bill, but can delegate responsibility for preparing the required  report to another committee member. An example of this Report can be found under  the &lsquo;instruction&rsquo; link.<br /><br />4. FLOOR ACTION AND ENACTMENT<br /><br />A bill  reported from committee is automatically sent to the leader of the chamber, who  then places it on the appropriate floor calendar. The bill may still see no  action beyond this point.<br /><br />In the U.S. House of Representatives, for  example, bills are debated chronologically (the first placed on the calendar is  the first to be considered). If your bill is not at the top of the calendar, the  other option is to persuade the legislature to pass a special rule proposed by  the Rules committee (see the Rules of Procedure and Tools tips for more  details). In the U.S. Senate, bills are brought to the floor according to terms  proposed by the majority leader and adopted by the legislature (see the Rules of  Procedure and Tool tips).<br /><br />Amendments, debate and voting<br /><br />Bills  placed on the calendar are open to amendment (the option of offering an  amendment is located at the bottom of the bill itself). The 'Sample Bill' under  the 'Instruction' link also offers information about the proper drafting of  committee or floor amendments. Whether an amendment is considered once the bill  reaches the floor voting stage depends on the procedures adopted. Under ordinary  U.S. House and Senate procedures, every amendment is in order and must be  considered. However, in both chambers there are ways to limit amendments. A  majority of legislators in the House can vote to &lsquo;end debate,&rsquo; cutting off  additional amendments. In the Senate, amendments can be limited through  unanimous consent agreements or by voting cloture (see the Rules of Procedure  and Tool tips).<br /><br />Floor debate<br /><br />LegSim includes tools for debating  issues on online. The leaders of parties, caucuses, committees and the chamber  all have the ability to create discussion threads on any subject, which are  indicated on the home page of the party, caucus etc. Once created, the members  of the group can contribute whenever they like. The value of these threads  obviously depends upon students. Hey can be a waste of time, but they can also  be very interesting, fun and informative if students use them as they are  intended. Like dear colleague letters, debate posts are visible to everyone and  as such reflect positively or negatively on the legislator making the  contribution.<br /><br />Hopefully, your simulation will also include at least one  in class debate, and it is also a good idea for committees to meet in person  whenever possible. Lawmaking is a human experience and restricting activities to  a web interface is, well, de-humanizing!<br /><br />Floor voting<br /><br />When the  leader schedules an on-line vote on a motion, amendment or bill, s/he also  decides the length of the voting period (typically 24 or 48 hours). A legislator  can change her vote until the voting period ends, so this can be an interesting  period of negotiation. When the vote closes, each legislator&rsquo;s position is  permanently and publicly indicated on her profile. When a legislator does not  vote, she is recorded as having been absent.<br /><br />Enactment<br /><br />In a single  chamber U.S. legislature simulation, a bill that passes the chamber is sent to  the President for a signature or veto. If the President signs the bill it  becomes law. If the President vetoes the bill, the chamber must pass a new  motion to override the President&rsquo;s veto (2/3rds majority). If this motion is  successful, your bill (finally!) becomes law.<br /><br />A bicameral U. S.  legislature simulation (House and Senate) is more complicated (of course!) and  is described in the tool tips. But essentially, the House and Senate leaders  must confirm (through enrollment) that each chamber has passed an identical  version of the bill. Then the bill goes to the President. If the President  vetoes, both chambers must vote to  override.<br />-------------------------<br /><br /></p>

  content: <p>Committee Chair Walkthrough<br /><p><a href="http://youtu.be/H2U0dguktb0" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/video-camera.png" alt="Committee Chair Video Tutorial"></a></p><br />To be an effective Chair, you need to  understand the legislative process. Information about this process and how it  works in LegSim can be found under the Rules of Procedure and Tool tips options  under the &lsquo;tutorials&rsquo; link on the sidebar. Additional information may also be  located with the tools themselves. Or, if you have a question that still needs  answering, send it to helpdesk@legsim.org.<br /><br />The leader&nbsp; (or instructor)  formally assigns chairs using the tool available at the leader's desk. Once this  has occurred, the chair&rsquo;s name is displayed at each committee under the  &lsquo;committees&rsquo; link and at the &lsquo;leadership' option under the &lsquo;floor&rsquo; link on the  sidebar.<br /><br />Committees are charged with reviewing and making recommendations  to the full chamber concerning legislative proposals. A committee can ignore a  bill; it can hold a hearing and recommend changes; it can hold a hearing and  then decide to not recommend the bill; or it can create its own bill on the same  subject. In other words, the committee can do whatever it wants. But the chamber  has options too. It can ignore a committee&rsquo;s recommendations when a bill is  reported to the floor, and it can also force a committee to report out a bill  that the committee opposes.<br /><br />As committee chair, you are charged with the  task of managing your committee&rsquo;s responsibilities with fairness and efficiency.  Every bill that is introduced is referred to a committee for initial  consideration. The committee can choose to ignore a bill, table it, schedule a  hearing, and if so, decide whether to recommend it to the chamber. If the bill  is reported (recommended), the committee chair is often also responsible for  promoting the bill&rsquo;s progress through the remainder of the process.<br /><br />The  chair is ultimately accountable for how well the committee functions. One of  your most important and challenging tasks will be to allocate responsibilities  and ensure that other committee members to do their share of the work. Good  luck!<br /><br />Powers Of The Chair<br /><br />To accomplish their responsibilities,  committee chairs have access to LegSim tools not available to other members. To  view these tools, go to your committee and click on the &lsquo;chairman&rsquo;s desk.&rsquo; You  will see that these options include initiating a hearing on a bill; scheduling  votes on committee amendments and reports, preparing committee reports, and  reporting a bill to the floor.<br /><br />These actions occur in sequence. For  example, no other action on a bill can be scheduled before a hearing has been  scheduled. Once a hearing has been scheduled, votes on amendments can be  scheduled. If your LegSim session is configured to require formal authorization  to report a bill, then you will need to schedule such a vote before a committee  report can be prepared and sent to the chamber.<br /><br />As chair, you decide  whether non-committee members can act as witnesses by contributing to committee  hearings, and you have the ability to assign responsibility for preparing a  report to another committee member.<br /><br />Because the committee process may not  be transparent to your committee colleagues, we suggest that you take a little  time to discuss it with them.<br /><br />Hearings<br /><br />A hearing can be a waste of  time or a valuable opportunity to improve a bill&rsquo;s prospects of success. Your  committee will need to prepare a committee report to accompany any bill that it  recommends to the chamber. This report explains why the committee supports the  bill. If a bill is already extremely popular or unpopular, the report will make  little difference. But if the bill is somewhere in the middle, a well prepared  report can make the difference.<br /><br />A committee hearing in this context can  also help to clarify key questions and concerns about the bill (possibly leading  to changes in its content), and it can be used to articulate why it is in  lawmakers&rsquo; political interests to support the bill. The committee report then  reports on what was discussed and decided by the committee. If some committee  members disagree with the majority&rsquo;s decision, their views should also be  reflected in the report.<br /><br />A chair is not required to schedule a hearing on  a bill. If you do so (with the implicit or explicit consent of the committee),  you will find the tool near the bottom of the chairman&rsquo;s desk. Just click on the  bill and you are set. Return to the committee page (i.e. leave your desk), the  click on &lsquo;enter hearings room.&rsquo; You will see the bill listed. Click on the bill  and you will see the beginnings of a discussion thread where you may want to  submit introductory remarks (your opportunity to frame the forthcoming debate!)  and later read comments submitted by your colleagues (in chronological  order).<br /><br />The discussion thread is just one option for a hearing. In person  hearings are probably preferred in many respects. But the discussion thread does  have value as a place where thoughtful comments can be archived, and we  encourage you to encourage colleagues to use it for this purpose. If committee  members just want to chat, then there are probably better options such as the  phone or free IM systems (IM names can be displayed on members&rsquo; profile  pages).<br /><br />Voting<br /><br />Your instructor configures LegSim so that formal  votes are, or are not, required to report a bill. When no formal vote is  required by the system, a bill can still only be reported with the support of a  committee majority AND the voting position of each committee member must be  indicated in the committee report. However it is up to you as chair to verify  both of these things.<br /><br />Members can propose amendments to bills that have  been scheduled for hearings. The tools for scheduling votes on these amendments  are also on your desk, but the actual process of considering amendment is  governed by you, and should proceed in the spirit of the chamber&rsquo;s Rules of  Procedure. In other words, as chair you do not really have the authority to pick  and choose among the amendments proposed. You need to establish a process that  is transparent and fair, and you should probably communicate this process before  things get rolling.<br /><br />As leader, you have the ability to modify the text of  the motion. It is your responsibility to read and ensure that what is in the  text box is what lawmakers are supposed to be voting on.<br /><br />On-line  amendment voting can be time consuming (committee members cannot always be on  line), and there may be more efficient ways to manage committee members&rsquo;  requests for legislative changes. For example, in the U.S. Congress, the end  result of committee deliberations will sometimes be the introduction of a new  bill. This bill is then referred to the committee by the Speaker, and quickly  reported by the committee. An advantage of this process is that the committee  can draft the bill that most closely reflects their ideals. A second efficiency  option is for the chair to bundle desired changes into a single committee  amendment before holding a vote. Of course, both of these options require  sufficient consensus within the committee.<br /><br />Preparing And Submitting  Reports<br /><br />A sample Committee Report can be found under the 'instruction'  link on the sidebar. The chair can designate another committee member to prepare  this report using tools on the desk, but the chair must formally submit the  report to the chamber.<br /><br />As always, we recommend copying and pasting your  Report from a document program such as Word. A committee report cannot be edited  once it has been submitted. So be sure that you are ready!<br /><br />Reporting A  Bill<br /><br />When the committee reports a bill, it cedes control to the chamber.  If the committee opposes a bill, the best way to defeat it may be to table it in  committee and not issue a report at all.<br /><br />When you report a bill to the  chamber, it goes to the chamber leader&rsquo;s desk. The leader then places it on the  appropriate calendar. The bill is unlikely to go any further without additional  intervention. Someone needs to be its advocate and the committee chair is in the  best position to do so. Ideally, you began this process of &lsquo;greasing the skids&rsquo;  much earlier, so that the chamber leadership has already set aside time for your  bill.<br /><br />Appropriations<br /><br />The U.S. Congress has two stage lawmaking  process for most issues. In the first, a law is passed that &lsquo;authorizes&rsquo; the  government to do something. In the second, a law is passed that &lsquo;appropriates&rsquo;  the funds to pay for doing that something. For example, a bill might authorize  the Army Corps of Engineers to build a dam, but the dam cannot actually be built  until the funds are appropriated to pay for its construction.<br /><br />Your class  may or may not have an Appropriations committee. If it does, a chair of another  committee, you will also need to work to see that funds are provided for the  programs your committee recommends. Thus you will probably want to establish a  close working relationship with the Appropriations committee chair and other  Appropriations committee members.<br /><br />Discharge Petitions<br /><br />A committee  is under no obligation to act on a bill. However, in the U.S. Congress, a  majority of the legislature can force a committee to send (discharge) a bill to  the chamber. A discharge petition requires the signatures of a majority of  members, so it should not come as a surprise. If discharge seems likely, it is  probably better to report such a bill on the committee&rsquo;s terms than to see it  forced from the committee.<br /><br />Managing Bills On The Floor<br /><br />As  mentioned, the committee chair (rather than the bill&rsquo;s original sponsor) is  typically responsible for managing bills when they reach the floor. The  committee chair doesn&rsquo;t have much of a role to play during on-line debates,  although it is still a good idea to frame the discussion as much as  possible.<br /><br />If a bill is being debated in class, then there will usually be  managers who are primarily responsible for allocating debate time to make the  best possible case for their positions. Typically, the committee chair manages  the &lsquo;support&rsquo; side of the bill, while the &lsquo;oppose&rsquo; side is managed by a minority  party leader. But the most important thing for each side is to select someone  who will delegate responsibilities to other supporters (opponents) to make the  best case for their side.<br /><br />Floor debates are about control! As a floor  manager, you want to keep the discussion focused on the topics that serve your  cause. A spontaneous debate is likely to prove much less interesting and  enlightening than one where the debaters have had time to form their thoughts.  In addition, if you call on someone without knowing what they are going to say,  it may backfire on you!<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Leadership is, in many respects, a  thankless task. Followers will be inclined to free ride, and it will be  impossible to please everyone. The compensation is that you hold more cards and  have more potential influence over what transpires. If you can&rsquo;t do everything  (and you can&rsquo;t), what are your top priorities? How will you motivate your  committee to do its work and to support your  agenda?<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br /></p>

  title: Chamber Leader Tutorial
  content: <p>Leader Walkthrough<br /><p><a href="http://youtu.be/FDJxSwEa7-Q" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/video-camera.png" alt="Chamber Leader Video Tutorial"></a></p><br />As chamber leader, you are charged with the task of  managing the legislature&rsquo;s responsibilities with fairness and efficiency. You  aren&rsquo;t a dictator. You act under the assumption that your decisions have the  support of the legislative majority. To lead requires that others are willing to  follow your lead.<br /><br />To be an effective leader, you need to understand the  legislative process or align with someone who knows it inside out. If you don&rsquo;t,  you will face challenges at the most inopportune time! Challenges mean loss of  control, and managing events is what leadership is all about. Uncertainty and  ignorance are handicaps! Knowledge and information are  strengths!<br /><br />Information about the legislative process and how it works in  LegSim can be found under the Rules of Procedure and Tool tips options under the  &lsquo;tutorials&rsquo; link on the sidebar. Additional information can also be found with  the tools themselves. It may be confusing the first time through so feel free to  send questions to support@legsim.org.<br /><br />Responsibilities<br /><br />The leader  is primarily responsible for managing the day to day affairs of the legislature,  from referring bills to committee to scheduling floor votes. The tools for  accomplishing these and many other tasks are found on the Leader&rsquo;s Desk under  the &lsquo;floor&rsquo; link. [Your instructor must designate you to be the chamber leader  before you have access to this desk]<br /><br />In addition to these administrative  responsibilities, the elected leader is in the best position to decide the  priorities of the legislature. It is important to recognize that there will be  many more demands than can be accommodated. Committees play a central role in  setting chamber priorities, but committees are still likely to report more bills  than can be accommodated. The legislature will turn to you to make the hard  decisions.<br /><br />Do not lead by trying to please everyone. Everyone likes you  now, but everyone will not like you by the end of the simulation! If making  everyone happy is not a reasonable end goal, then ask yourself what you would  like to accomplish? Set priorities; draft a plan for getting there, but one that  is sufficiently adaptable to changing circumstances.<br /><br />The Leader's  Desk<br /><br />Your desk includes a number of tools. You should know that the  instructor also has access to these tools in addition to other tools. For  example, the instructor can remove a bill from the system while you cannot, and  can schedule any bill for floor debate and voting while you are limited to those  that the rules allow.<br /><br />There are too many tools to discuss them in detail  here. The first time that you use one may be a little baffling, but you&rsquo;ll  quickly get the hang of it. If the information you need is not there, send your  question to support@legsim.org<br /><br />Your first formal action will probably be  assign members to committees. This is a collective decision. Your job is to  implement the chamber&rsquo;s recommendations. The same goes for assigning committee  chairs, which should shortly follow the assignment of committee  positions.<br /><br />Once the committees are up and running, your next task is to  give the committees something to do. It falls to you to refer bills to their  appropriate committees. You have 24 hours to refer a bill that has been  introduced. A bill is typically referred to just one committee based on a match  between its primary subject and a committee&rsquo;s issue responsibilities. A bill can  also be referred to multiple committees, but such a bill cannot be considered by  the legislature until all committees have reported it. The Speaker also has the  ability to discharge a bill from committee &ndash; but only in accordance with  legislative procedure.<br /><br />Scheduling floor consideration<br /><br />As the first  stop in the legislative process, committees have a big impact on floor  proceedings. Most bills die in committee. But more importantly for you, you  depend on committees to produce legislation in a timely manner. The fact is that  your legislative session is not very long. If you sit back and wait for  committees to act, there&rsquo;s a good chance that valuable time will be wasted.  Equally important, the committees that do act may not be the ones that share  your priorities.<br /><br />A competent leader is pro-active. S/he communicates with  committee chairs, sending clear signals about her priorities. Committee chairs  will often be receptive to these requests, because if the leader likes a bill,  that bill has a better chance of getting to the floor. And that counts for  something. But of course, this is a two way street. A smart leader will also  want to grease the skids by assisting a committee in advancing one or two  priorities of its own! &ldquo;You scratch my back&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />When a committee reports a  bill, you will receive a message indicating that it is on your desk. You then  need to place it on the appropriate calendar as defined by the rules. <br />IN THE  HOUSE, you can only schedule bills for consideration based on their order on the  calendar (you will only see one bill at a time on the vote scheduling page). The  alternative to this process is a special rule issued by the Rules committee. A  special rule (described in more detail in the Rules of Procedure) is a proposal  to bring a bill to the floor out of its order on the calendar, according to the  terms specified in the special rule. <br />Only the Rules committee can propose a  special rule (and only on a bill that has been placed on the calendar). Once the  rule has been adopted and reported by the Rules committee,&nbsp; you must schedule a  vote on the special rule. If the chamber formally approves the rule, you will  then notice that the bill itself is available to be scheduled on the vote  scheduling page. <br />Members can also offer amendments to bills that have been  placed on the calendar. If a bill comes to the floor under ordinary procedure,  all germane amendments introduced in advance must be considered before the bill  can be brought up for a final vote. On the other hand, a special rule (if it is  approved) can limit amendments (and do many other things too!)<br /><br />IN THE  SENATE, bills on the calendar are brought up using a 'motion to proceed'  proposed by the majority leader. The Floor/Calendar page of a Senate LegSim  session describes how this works.<br /><br />Voting<br /><br />Scheduling a vote is not  complicated. But if you try to do things in a hurry you may make mistakes (For  example you might schedule a vote to begin and end at the same time &ndash; this makes  it hard for senators to vote!)<br /><br />As leader, you have the ability to modify  the text of any motion. It is your responsibility to read and ensure that what  is in the text box is what lawmakers are supposed to be voting on. For example,  if amendments have been adopted, then the bill as described in the final vote  motion needs to be different from what was originally  introduced.<br /><br />Procedural motions<br /><br />In Congress, certain motions have  precedence. For example, if a member feels that the rules are being violated,  action is suspended until the motion is dealt with. Another example is that a  majority of house members can vote to &ldquo;end debate&rdquo; or &ldquo;move the previous  question.&rdquo; The effect of these motions is to bring an amendment or a bill to an  immediate vote (in the latter case, preventing consideration of additional  pending amendments). These privileged motions are described in the Rules of  Procedure.<br /><br />The leader rules on these motions. For example if a member  objects that an amendment is not germane, the leader would decide the question.  Although this rarely happens in the U.S. House (it is more common in the  Senate), a member of the body can the appeal the Speaker&rsquo;s ruling to the  chamber. If a majority agrees, the chair&rsquo;s ruling is reversed.<br /><br />Dealing  with procedural motions during on-line voting can be tricky and LegSim does not  provide a simple answer. As leader, you will need to decide how to deal with  them fairly and efficiently in the event that they come up. Clearly  communicating the reasoning behind your decisions is the best way to avoid  misinterpretations of your intentions.<br /><br />In Class Debates<br /><br />In class  debates are important. They provide opportunities to network and on-line  interactions are simply not as interesting. It&rsquo;s a very good idea to schedule an  in-class debate early in the term. In our experience, a debate on a  controversial subject stimulates activity throughout the simulation. So the  sooner the better! To pull this off, you will need at least one committee to  send you a good bill early in the process. By &lsquo;good bill,&rsquo; we mean a bill that  addresses an important issue (from the perspective of your colleagues) and that  is likely to divide them, such as immigration reform or a resolution proposing a  troop withdrawal. There are lots of possibilities.<br /><br />For each bill that  comes to the floor, you need to assign managers. On the support side, the  committee chair is your first choice. On the oppose side, it might be a minority  member of the committee or another member who feels passionately about the  issue.<br /><br />Particularly for the first debate, you want students to prepare.  The primary role of the managers is to frame the debate with opening statements,  and then to allocate their limited time to other members who share their  position, but hopefully will make additional thoughtful contributions to the  discussion. As the Rules of Procedure describe, the floor managers control the  time. Another member cannot speak unless the manager who controls the time  yields. If things go well, a lot of legislators will be stimulated to contribute  to the discussion even if they do not have the opportunity to do so.<br /><br />You  do not have to preside during this debate. Remember that you are a political  leader and not just a clerk. Use this opportunity to advance your views on the  bill and your agenda more generally.<br /><br />The leader can temporarily delegate  the chair to another member (a leadership team is recommended). This member is  then responsible for keeping track of the time used by each side, responding to  procedural questions that may arise, and when appropriate, supervising any  voting that may occur (be sure to have a way to enter votes in the event that  recorded votes are requested). Things may be a little clunky the first time  through but your class will quickly get the hang of it!<br /><br /></p>

    <p class="standardBox">Each Representative is popularly elected and has one vote  in the legislature. The Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, and Delegates from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, and the  Virgin Islands are also elected pursuant to federal law. The Resident  Commissioner and Delegates have most of the prerogatives of Representatives  including the right to vote in the committees to which they are elected.  However, they do not have the right to vote on matters before the LegSimlature.  A Commissioner or Delegate may take a position, but his or her vote cannot  decide whether a motion passes or fails.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">A Representative cannot be removed by anyone but his or her  constituents. However, it is still important to recognize that your colleagues  exercise a lot of influence over your success in the legislature. Will you be  selected to serve on an important committee? Will your bill get a hearing? Will  you have a chance to speak on issues before the chamber?</p>

    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Norms and Sanctions</strong></div>
    <p class="standardBox">Congress also operates according to expected standards of  behavior, or norms. One important norm is that members address their colleagues  respectfully, regardless of how heated the debate becomes. Each member is  speaking for citizens rather than for him or herself. The views of those  constituents are to be respected. The practical benefit is that such a norm  helps to keep things civil, which makes progress more likely. Disagreement is  respected, even encouraged (how else do we come to see things in a different  light?). But this is most likely to occur when the position and not the person  is attacked. Members address their colleagues as representatives rather than  individuals. For example, Representative Larry Craig (R-ID) is addressed as "the  distinguished representative from the fine state of Idaho" or something along  those lines. Never forget that you need a majority to win, and that politics  makes strange bedfellows. There's always a chance that today's opponent will be  tomorrow's ally. Famous quotes such as "Politics makes strange bedfellows,"  "Don't burn your bridges," and "Always throw your golf clubs ahead of you"  (Ronald Reagan) point to the strategic value of anger management in  politics!</p>
    <p class="standardBox">Congress cannot expel a member who misbehaves, even if that  member breaks the law. The House can ""censure a member, which means that he or  she no longer permitted to speak on the floor. The procedural consequences of  censure may not seem all that severe but it effectively means that a member is  no longer an equal participant in the process and will be treated accordingly.  This is likely to create some trouble at home, so taking actions that might lead  to censure need to be carefully evaluated. In addition, there are many other  informal ways in which legislators can sanction members who are deemed to be  uncooperative, untrustworthy, or both.</p>
    <p><a name="Leaders_and_Parties"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Leaders and Parties</strong></div>
    <p class="standardBox">The U.S. Constitution calls for a Speaker of the House of  Representatives to be selected by the legislature in a manner of its choosing.  The Speaker manages day to day proceedings and interprets and applies the rules  of the legislature in consultation with the Parliamentarian.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">The Speaker serves at the majority's discretion and is  elected in the first days of the session. In Congress, the Speaker is formally  chosen on the first day of the Congress. Informally, the decision is made in the  majority party caucus, using&nbsp;a secret 'successive elimination' ballot. An  initial vote is held among all of the nominated candidates. The candidate that  receives the fewest votes is eliminated, and a second vote is held. This process  continues until only one candidate is standing. Although time consuming, this  process ensures that the winning candidate receives a majority (and also poses  interesting strategic opportunities you might want to consider!). The party  caucuses then vote as&nbsp; blocs for their preferred candidates during the formal  decision.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">In addition to presiding over the legislature, the Speaker  plays the central role in setting the agenda of the legislature, since s/he is  the only one who officially represents the views of most members. Typically  Speakers have extraordinary influence over decisions about committee assignments  and leadership positions, because these are central to his or her ability to set  the agenda.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">Speakers serve with the consent of the majority. Any member  can make a motion to declare the office of the Speaker vacant. This  motion/resolution is offered as a matter of high constitutional privilege, which  means that it has precedence over all other motions except the motion to  adjourn. It need not be considered immediately, but it must be put to a vote  within two days of being offered.</p>
    <p><a name="Wheres_the_Party"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Where's the Party?</strong></div>
    <p class="standardBox">The U.S. Constitution does not provide for political  parties. Nevertheless, parties are central to lawmaking today, especially in the  House of Representatives. Your legislature must decide for itself whether  members will create and join informal caucuses of similarly inclined  legislators. A party caucus has advantages when its members have similar goals.  Acting in concert, a party majority can decide&nbsp;the Speaker and&nbsp;structure the  committee system. If you are a member of the&nbsp;minority party, your influence will  be proportionately reduced.&nbsp;In the U.S. House, for example, far fewer&nbsp;bills  sponsored by&nbsp;minority&nbsp;party members emerge from committee.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">All procedural questions and disputes are decided by  majority rule. Typically, party caucuses meet in advance to debate and plot  strategy. Party leaders expect party members&nbsp;to&nbsp;support what the caucus has  decided (e.g. who will be Speaker; a procedural ruling by the Speaker).&nbsp;  Defections do occur, however,&nbsp;and leaders&nbsp;need to exercise care to keep their  coalitions together, particularly&nbsp;if their majority is slim.</p>
    <p><a name="Types_of_Legislation"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of Legislation</span></strong></div>
    <p class="standardBox">Congress acts by passing legislation. There are two types  of legislation, bills and resolutions. You will need to specify which type of  legislation you are introducing. A member can introduce as many pieces of  legislation as he or she chooses on any subject.</p>
    <p><a name="Bills"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Bills</strong></div>
    <p class="standardBox">A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether  permanent or temporary, general or special, public or private. In your  LegSimlature, a bill has the prefix "PB" followed by an automatically assigned  number that indicates the order in which it was introduced (in the U.S. House a  bill is an H.R.). It retains this number through all of the stages of the  legislative process.</p>
    <p class="standardBox">A bill becomes law only after --</p>
    <div class="standardBox">
    <ul>
    <li>The Chamber passes the bill; </li>
    <li>The President approves of the bill, or </li>
    <li>The President fails to return it with objections within 10 days, or </li>
    <li>The Chamber overrides the presidential veto by a two-thirds  vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>To override a President's veto, the chamber must vote on a privileged motion  to "sustain the President's veto." This motion fails if 2/3rds of the  legislature votes against it. A bill can also be "pocket vetoed" if the  LegSimlature adjourns without giving the President a full 10 days to veto  it.</p>
    <p><a name="Resolutions"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Resolutions</strong></div>
    <p>Resolutions carry the prefix "PR" and do not have the force of law, nor do  they require the support of the President (in the House a resolution is an  H.Res. or an H.J. Res.). Resolutions are typically used to express symbolic  support (e.g. declare July 22nd 2005 'Lance Armstrong Day'), to propose  Constitutional amendments to the states, and to propose changes to internal  procedures (e.g. special rules).</p>
    <p><a name="Bill_Introduction_and_Referral_to_Committee"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bill Introduction and Referral to  Committee</span></strong></div>
    <p>Any Member may introduce a bill on any subject at any time while the  LegSimlature is in session. The Member who submits the bill is its sponsor.  Members sponsor bills for many different reasons. Because the default  expectation is a that a bill will fail (Only about 10 percent of the bills  introduced in the U.S. House become law) it may be a good strategy to have lots  of balls in the air. Even if they go nowhere, bills give members something to  point to when constituents ask "what have you done for me lately?"</p>
    <p>An unlimited number of additional members may sign on as co-sponsors. Members  who co-sponsor on the day that it is introduced are "original" co-sponsors.  Members who co-sponsor after this time are "additional" co-sponsors. Changes in  co-sponsorship are only permitted up until the time that a bill has been  reported from all of the committees to which it was referred.</p>
    <p>Every member tends to be concerned about his or her own bills first. Thus, it  is incumbent on members to make others aware of their policy proposals, and to  frame those proposals in ways that attract sufficient support to "keep the ball  rolling." Entrepreneurs should consider "talking their ideas around" before  actually introducing a bill to avoid including provisions that guarantee defeat.  After introducing a bill, the sponsor should increase awareness and solicit  support in person or via Dear Colleague letters.</p>
    <p>A member can request that a bill be withdrawn by unanimous consent. A member  who desires to modify his or her own bill can seek amendments at later stages in  the process, or may choose to introduce and announce a new bill incorporating  the desired changes.</p>
    <p>Congress divides its workload by subject (jurisdiction). All bills and  resolutions pertaining to a particular issue area are referred to the committee  with responsibility or jurisdiction over that issue. (Rule X of House procedure  specifies the jurisdictions of its committees.) It is the Speaker's  responsibility to refer bills and resolutions to the appropriate committee(s)  with the Parliamentarian's guidance. If a proposed bill cuts across  jurisdictions, the Speaker may decide to refer it to multiple committees. (In  Congress, 8 out of 10 bills are referred to just one committee.) Multiple  referral has its advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is better  information about a bill's effects. The main disadvantage is inefficiency. The  bill cannot progress until every committee has reported (and some may choose not  to). In referring a bill to multiple committees, the Speaker may instruct a  committee to report a bill by a date certain, although such time limits are  almost never placed on the first (primary) committee to which a bill is  referred.</p>
    <p><a name="Committee_Consideration"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Committee Consideration</span></strong></div>
    <p>This is perhaps the most important phase of the legislative process.  Committees are smaller groups of legislators who provide the most intensive  review of proposed measures within an issue jurisdiction. In addition,  committees are often important sources of policy ideas, due to their members'  exceptional interest and knowledge of the subject area. The committee chair sets  the committee's agenda under ordinary circumstances. Committees have negative  and positive agenda setting powers. They can effectively prevent bills from  being considered by the legislature (negative), and they can shape the terms of  the proposals that the legislature does consider (positive). Committees do much  more of the former. Only 1 out of 9 bills introduced in the US House makes it  past this stage.</p>
    <p>A quorum (majority) of committee members must be present for it to do  business. The absence of a quorum is subject to a point of order - an objection  that the proceedings violate a rule of the committee. A member makes this  objection by seeking recognition from the chair, and asking (for example) "Ms  Chairwoman, I move that a quorum is not present to do business." If a majority  is not present, the committee meeting is adjourned.</p>
    <p><a name="Committee_Assignment"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Committee Assignment</strong></div>
    <p>The legislature decides the procedures for assigning members to committees  and for choosing committee chairs. (This is another instance of where the  equality implied by one legislator/one vote breaks down.) In the U.S. House, the  majority party caucus decides how many members serve on each committee, and how  many of those seats will will be held by party members. The party caucuses then  decide how to allocate the positions available to their party's members.</p>
    <p>Newly elected members request committee assignments. Incumbents (reelected  members) retain their committee seats, leaving freshmen to battle for the less  than prime vacancies that remain. Committee chairs and ranking minority members  are also chosen by the party caucuses. Ordinarily, these are the most senior  (not oldest) members of the committee, but party caucuses have demonstrated an  increased willingness to break this norm, especially for important committees.  In addition, House Republicans have term limited some committee positions,  further undermining the "seniority rule."</p>
    <p>The seniority rule is, of course, not very relevant to these decisions as  they apply to your LegSimlature! So what guides freshmen assignment decisions?  Research suggests that leaders try to balance the shared goal of getting a  member reelected with the needs of the caucus and chamber. Reelection is often  the primary concern, so most members will win appointment to one committee that  has an electoral connection (e.g. agriculture or transportation). The second  committee assignment, if one is available, is less predictable. It might be a  committee that needs to be staffed (such as the committee overseeing the  District of Columbia), or it might be a more prestigious (appropriations) or  policy oriented committee (judiciary) depending on a member's prior expertise or  skill at playing politics.</p>
    <p><a name="Scheduling_a_Committee_Meeting"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Scheduling a Committee Meeting</strong></div>
    <p>The rules of your legislature require that committees meet at least once per  month. [Your instructor may choose to revise these requirements.] The chairman  may convene additional meetings at his or her discretion, or two committees may  formally request (e.g. via a Dear Colleague letter) that the chairman call a  special meeting on a specific measure or measures. If the chairman does not call  for the requested special meeting within three days (to be held within seven  days), then a majority of the committee may call the meeting without the  chairman's consent by accepting the terms of a formal statement of the date,  hour, location, and the measure(s) to be considered.</p>
    <p><a name="Committee_Actions"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Committee Actions</strong></div>
    <p>Committees meet to review and make recommendations regarding proposed bills  or to hold hearings to investigate a topic without considering specific  legislation. A "non-legislative hearing of this kind may be designed to draw  public attention to an issue, hoping to spur congressional action, or may even  lead to a committee-drafted bill to be introduced at a later date.</p>
    <p><a name="Hearings"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Hearings</strong></div>
    <p>All committee meetings are open to the public, unless a majority of committee  members votes publicly to close it. A committee is not required to hold a  hearing on a bill but may choose to do so if the bill is considered to be of  sufficient importance. Each committee, except for the Committee on Rules, is  required to publicly announce at least 1 day in advance any hearing to be  conducted by the committee, unless the committee chairman with the concurrence  of the ranking minority member or a majority of the committee determines that  there is good cause to begin the hearing earlier (in which case the chairman  must publicly announce the hearing as soon as possible). These announcements are  made via Dear Colleague letters.</p>
    <p>A majority of committee members may vote to subpoena witnesses. The power to  authorize and issue subpoenas may also be delegated to the chairman. A subpoena  may require both testimonial and documentary evidence to be furnished to the  committee. An official reporter is present to record the testimony. After a  brief introductory statements by committee members, the first witness is called  and questioned. Each committee member is entitled to call at least one witness  of their own to testify.</p>
    <p><a name="Markup"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Markup</strong></div>
    <p>After hearings are completed, the committee usually will consider the bill or  bills in a session that is popularly known as the "markup" session. The views of  members and witnesses are considered, revisions to the legislation proposed and  voted on, and a vote is taken to determine the action of the committee. Proxy  voting (voting without being present) is not permitted. The Committee may decide  collectively to report a bill favorably (with or without amendment),  unfavorably, or without recommendation. The committee may also "table" a bill,  postponing action indefinitely. Bills are rarely reported unfavorably. More  commonly, committees choose to exercise negative agenda control over bills that  they do not favor. This is much more efficient.</p>
    <p>Committee amendments are only proposals (by a few members) to alter the  language of the bill as introduced. Members may only offer germane amendments  (amendments that do not introduce new subjects to the bill). The proposed  changes must be fully described in the committee report (see the 'sample bill'  link under the 'Instruction' link of the LegSim website).</p>
    <p>If the committee approves extensive changes to the bill, it may decide to  report a single amendment "in the nature of a substitute" consisting of a  complete bill text. Less frequently (for example when multiple bills on the same  subject are introduced), a committee may decide to draft its own "clean" bill  during a markup. The drafted language is approved by the committee and  (typically) the chairman heads off to write both the report and the bill. The  bill is then introduced according to normal procedure. When it has been referred  to the committee, it is immediately reported along with the pre-drafted  report.</p>
    <p><a name="The_Substance_of_Reports"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>The Substance of Committee  Reports</strong></div>
    <p>Committee reports are used by legislators, courts, executive departments, and  the public to interpret the purpose and meaning of a law. For example, the  original committee reports regarding the establishment of the food and drug  commission were reviewed by the Supreme Court when the FDA's authority to  regulate tobacco advertising was challenged (the court decided that Congress did  not "intend" for the FDA to have this power). Reports describe the purpose and  scope of the bill and the reasons for its recommended approval by the  chamber.</p>
    <p>The report on a bill that has been reported favorably must include (1) the  committee's findings and recommendations including proposed amendments, and (2)  an estimate of any new budget authority and an estimate of any increase or  decrease in revenues or tax expenditures for the next fiscal year and the next  five fiscal years (or the duration of the program if less than five years).  Budget authority refers to the amount of new spending obligations (e.g. "The  committee estimates that the new national ID card will cost $12 billion (not $10  billion) in the first year, and $36 billion over the next five years.").  Proposals with tax and revenue implications are considered differently. Tax  related bills must also be referred to Ways and Means. In addition, reports on  bills that contain federal unfunded mandates (policies that obligate state or  local governments to spend money to implement federal requirements) must also  include an estimate of the cost of those mandates. Bills that raise taxes or  include unfunded mandates require 3/5ths support in the House instead of a  simple majority.</p>
    <p>Each committee member's vote on the question of whether to favorably report  the bill must be specified in the report. Members of the committee may submit  supplemental, minority, or additional views, which will be included in the  report if they are provided in a timely manner.</p>
    <p><a name="Filing_of_Reports"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Filing of Reports</strong></div>
    <p>Reports must be filed within 7 days of the approval of a bill by the  committee. A bill or resolution reported by a committee must then layover for 3  calendar days before it can be brought up for consideration in the full  chamber.</p>
    <p><a name="From_the_Committee_to_the_Floor"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From the Committee to the  Floor</span></strong></div>
    <p>The House of Representatives has well defined procedures for bringing bills  to the floor. But there are procedures and then there are practices. Most bills  are not considered according to the ordinary procedures of the House but are  instead considered under a variety of special procedures.</p>
    <p>A bill that is favorably reported from committee is moved to the Union  Calendar. (The U.S. House has multiple calendars of which the Union Calendar is  the most important). Under ordinary procedure, bills are then scheduled for  floor consideration in the order in which they were placed on that calendar.  Thus, the most recently reported is the last to be taken up. Because time is  limited, the legislature typically employs other procedures that enable it to  give priority to bills that are more important or urgent, and to quickly  dispense with non-controversial legislation.</p>
    <p>The Speaker is primarily responsible for managing the floor schedule. As such  the use of special procedures such as those described below is carefully  guarded. A member who hopes to see his bill brought to the floor will probably  want to consult in advance with the leadership, as unscheduled motions are  likely to be defeated as a threat to the leader's prerogative in this area.</p>
    <p><a name="Unanimous_Consent_Motion"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Unanimous Consent Motion</strong></div>
    <p>One option for circumventing the Union Calendar is to pass a reported or even  unreported bill or resolution by unanimous consent. On the floor, a member would  seek recognition from the chair (Speaker), and then move (for example) that  "PB11, raising the federal speed limit to 90 miles per hour in rural area be  approved by unanimous consent." The Speaker would then ask "Is there objection?  There being no objection, the measure is adopted." Of course, the chances of  such a motion passing are very slim for legislation that is even slightly  controversial.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Suspend_the_Rules"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to Suspend the Rules</strong></div>
    <p>Every Friday (or a date chosen by your legislature - in the U.S. House it is  Wednesday), the Speaker MAY choose to entertain a motion to suspend the rules  and immediately pass a bill or resolution by two-thirds of those present.  Members must arrange in advance to be recognized to offer such a motion. The  Speaker usually recognizes only a member of the committee that reported or has  primary jurisdiction over the bill. The motion to suspend the rules and pass the  bill is debatable for 10 minutes (equally divided between supporters and  opponents). No amendments are permitted, with the exception of a manager's  amendment (e.g. a version of the bill that includes the committee's recommended  changes) included in the motion itself. Most bills in the U.S. House of  Representatives pass under this procedure. The motion to suspend the rules may  NOT be used to temporarily suspend any other rule.</p>
    <p><a name="Calendar_Friday"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Calendar Friday</strong></div>
    <p>On the second Friday of each month (or a date chosen by your legislature in  advance of the session), and unless dispensed with by an affirmative vote of  two-thirds present, the committees are called in alphabetical order. The  committee that is called then brings up for consideration one bill it has  reported at least three days earlier. Debate proceeds under ordinary procedure  (see below). No committee is permitted to bring up a second bill under this  procedure until all standing committees have been called.</p>
    <p><a name="Special_Resolution_or_Rule"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Special Resolution or "Rule"</strong></div>
    <p>Bills can also be taken up out of their order on the calendar if the  legislature adopts a special resolution or "rule" proposed by the Committee on  Rules. The Committee may draft a rule on any bill or resolution regardless of  where it is in the process. The committee chairmen will typically ask the Rules  Committee to introduce and report a special resolution (PR) that proposes to  circumvent the Union Calendar procedure (see draft language below). This  "special rule" can propose almost anything because it is meaningless if a  majority of legislators does not approve it.</p>
    <p>A special rule might do nothing more than move a bill up the calendar, or it  might prohibit any debate or amendments to a bill. The sky's the limit! The only  restrictions are that the recorded votes are still required if requested and  that a member of the losing side is always entitled to offer a motion to  recommit the bill to committee (see below) before the final passage vote.</p>
    <p>Rules Committee meetings need not be open to the public, and the Speaker can  bring up a resolution from the Committee on Rules immediately. If the Speaker  does not bring it up immediately, any member of the Committee on Rules may call  it up as a privileged matter after seven days have elapsed, as long as he or she  gives one day's notice. The Speaker must then recognize any member of the  committee for that purpose.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Draft  Special Rule</strong><br /><br />Resolved, that upon the adoption of this resolution  the Speaker declares pursuant to rule XVIII that the House consider the bill  (H.R.__) entitled, etc., and the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed  with. After general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall  continue not to exceed __ minutes (or hours), to be equally divided and  controlled by __, the bill shall be read for amendment under the (xx) minute  rule. At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the  previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill shall be brought to  a final vote without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or  without instructions.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Discharge_a_Committee"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to Discharge a Committee</strong></div>
    <p>Finally, any Member may petition to discharge any committee (including Rules)  from considering a bill or resolution if that committee has not reported the  measure within 14 days of receiving it. When a majority of the legislature has  signed the member's discharge petition, any signing Member may seek recognition  on the floor for the purpose of calling up the motion. The motion is then  debated for 20 minutes (equally divided between supporters and opponents) before  it is voted on. If the motion to discharge passes, the bill or resolution is  immediately considered under ordinary floor procedures. If the motion is  defeated, it is referred to the calendar as if it had been reported favorably by  a standing committee.</p>
    <p>The Rules committee also has at least one other important power in this  regard. Under unusual circumstances, it may also draft a resolution providing  for the "discharge" and consideration of a measure that has not yet been  reported by a standing committee, thus circumventing the petition process. This  is typically reserved for instances where a multiply referred bill is being  delayed by the inaction of one (secondary) committee.</p>
    <p><a name="Floor_Consideration_and_Debate"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Floor Consideration and  Debate</span></strong></div>
    <p>As mentioned, the U.S. House debates the preliminaries of bills, including  amendments in the Committee of the Whole. This enables the legislature to act  with just 100 members present instead of a simple majority of 218. At the  conclusion of debate, this "committee" rises and the full House convenes to  consider only those amendments that passed in the Committee of the Whole, before  deciding the final fate of the bill. Your LegSimlature has a single floor  process where a majority of members must be present in order to do business.</p>
    <p>There is a logic to parliamentary debate. Certain motions take precedence  because they often affect whether debate proceeds fairly or expeditiously. As a  legislator, it is essential that you know how and when to offer such motions.  The Parliamentarian (ideally an objective observer such as your instructor)  assists the Speaker in making the correct ruling on questions of procedure.  Knowledgeable members will also want to assist, often to their own benefit, if  they know the rules in advance!</p>
    <p>P<a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/floor_pocket.htm">ocket guide to  debate for the House can be found here</a></p>
    <p>A member cannot make a motion before he or she has been formally recognized.  Because rules can be abused, the Speaker is expected to ensure that the rules  are applied as intended by the legislature. For example, a member or members may  offer multiple motions to adjourn (below) with the goal of disrupting or  delaying the completion of a debate. In this case, the Speaker might want to  rule that the motion is "dilatory and therefore out of order." In extreme  circumstances the Speaker might choose not to recognize a member, or in truly  extreme circumstances another member might offer a motion to censure the member  thereby prohibiting his or her participation in the debate.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Adjourn"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to Adjourn</strong></div>
    <p>When the House is in session, the motion to adjourn takes precedence over all  other action. If adopted by majority, the legislature suspends debate until it  reconvenes at a later date. It then picks up where it left off, unless a motion  is proposed and adopted that does not violate the terms of the current  proceedings. For example, if debate on a bill was occurring according to the  terms of a special rule, then other business must wait until that debate has  been completed. The only exceptions involve privileged motions.</p>
    <p><a name="Questions_of_Privilege"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Questions of Privilege</strong></div>
    <p>A question of privilege takes precedence over all questions except the motion  to adjourn. Questions of privilege are questions 1) affecting the rights of the  legislature collectively, such as its safety, dignity, and integrity, and 2)  affecting the rights, reputations, and conduct of Members individually or in  their representative capacity. Questions of Privilege concerning the legislature  at large are introduced as resolutions (PR) and can be called up by any Member  after proper notice.</p>
    <p>A question of personal privilege, affecting the rights, reputation, and  conduct of individual Members (e.g. a motion to censure), may be raised from the  floor without formal notice. A member seeks recognition ("Madame Speaker, a  question of privilege") and poses the question. Debate is limited to 20 minutes  equally divided and no amendments or other motions (other than the motion to  adjourn) are in order.</p>
    <p><a name="Privileged_Matters"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Privileged Matters</strong></div>
    <p>Certain matters, such as a motion to sustain the President's veto or  consideration of a special rule may interrupt the normal order of business. The  Member in charge of such a matter can call it up at any time for immediate  consideration as long as no other business is pending. This means that it can  only be brought up if no other bill or resolution is currently being  debated.</p>
    <p>Questions of privilege affect the rights of the House collectively, or the  rights, reputation or conduct of its members. Privileged motions have precedence  over all other motions except the motion to adjourn. Privileged matters are  usually brought up after consultation with the leadership but they must be  considered within two days of being offered.</p>
    <p><a name="General_Debate"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>General Debate</strong></div>
    <p>The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the rules adopted at the  opening of each House and by precedents that have been established and applied  over many years.</p>
    <p>The House has a long-standing rule that the provisions of Thomas Jefferson's  Manual should govern the House in all applicable cases and where they are not  inconsistent with the rules of the House. The House also relies on an 11-volume  compilation of parliamentary precedents, entitled Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's  Precedents of the House of Representatives, dating from 1789 to 1935. A later  compilation, Deschler-Brown Precedents of the House of Representatives, spans 15  volumes and covers 1936 to date. In addition, a summary of the House precedents  prior to 1959 can be found in a single volume entitled Cannon's Procedure in the  House of Representatives. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, fourth  edition, as supplemented, and House Practice, published in 1996, are recent  compilations of the precedents of the House, in summary form, together with  other useful related material. Also, various rulings of the Chair are set out as  notes in the current House Rules and Manual. Just thought you'd like to know in  case you have questions about procedure that are not answered here!</p>
    <p><a name="Points_of_Order"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Points of Order</strong></div>
    <p>The members of the legislature are solely responsible for enforcing the  proper application of its rules. A member who believes that the rules are not  being followed must first gain recognition from the chair (e.g. "Madam Speaker,  I rise to make a point of order"). The chair responds, "For what purpose does  the member rise?" The member then states his or her objection as it pertains to  the rules (e.g. "Madame Speaker, the amendment is not germane to the bill.").  Points of order are not debatable. It is up to the Speaker to decide to sustain  the point of order. If it is denied, any member can seek recognition and "appeal  the Speaker's decision to the floor." The appeal is put to an immediate vote. In  the U.S. House, such appeals rarely if ever succeed because the party caucus  invariable supports the Speaker's ruling and because the Speaker usually adheres  to precedent.</p>
    <p><a name="Ordinary_Debate"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Ordinary Debate</strong></div>
    <p>Someone must manage bills that are brought to the floor to ensure that the  strongest arguments are heard, to ensure efficient use of limited time, and to  avoid surprises at this late and critical stage in a bill's progress. Often the  managers are the chair and ranking minority member of the reporting committee,  although this need not be the case. Certainly, the managers need to be among  those who are very familiar with the issue and are prepared to defend their  side. But the other important function of the manager is to manage available  time to make the best case that 1) the bill is a good idea and is well  conceived, and 2) that it has widespread support. Few members will have studied  the bill (sad but true even in the real Congress!) and will be deciding based on  less than complete information.</p>
    <p>The manager needs to come prepared to respond to the concerns of key  legislators (no need to waste time on committed opponents and supporters). What  are the wafflers concerns? Obviously, during floor debate is not the best time  to learn such things! The manager wants to come to the floor prepared with  answers and with other legislators prepared to anticipate and respond to  concerns about the bill. The same is true for opponents, who can reasonably  expect that this is their last opportunity to kill the beast, whatever its  proper title.</p>
    <p>The Speaker equally allocates the available minutes for debate to the floor  managers. It is then their responsibility to determine who will have an  opportunity to speak, for how long, and in what order. Thus, a member who wishes  to speak on a bill (or offer an amendment) will contact the manager in advance  of the debate.</p>
    <p><a name="Quorum"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Quorum</strong></div>
    <p>Article 1, Section 5, of the Constitution states that a majority is required  to do business and permits a smaller number of legislators to compel the  attendance of absent Members. Once again, the quorum only applies when it is  enforced and the legislature may conduct much of its business with fewer members  present. In the absence of a quorum (a majority of members), 4 members may  initiate a roll call of members to compel their attendance: "Mr. Speaker, I  demand a call of the roll." The Speaker then directs those in favor of the  motion to stand and be counted. If the request is supported by at least 1/5th of  a quorum, the clerk is ordered to call the roll. The quorum call may be  suspended once a majority has recorded its presence, or if no one objects to a  motion to suspend it.</p>
    <p><a name="The_Reading_of_the_Bill"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>The Reading of the Bill</strong></div>
    <p>Formally, a bill is read in its entirety by the clerk prior to debate. This  reading can be dispensed with at the request of a member: "Mr. Speaker, I ask  that the reading be dispensed with." "Is there objection? There being no  objection, so ordered." If there is objection, a majority of members must vote  to dispense with the reading. Amendments are also read before they are  debated.</p>
    <p><a name="General_Debate"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Debate</span></strong></div>
    <p>The debate on a bill is divided into consideration of the bill ("general  debate") and consideration of proposed amendments.</p>
    <p>In the absence of a special rule, 20 minutes of general debate are allowed,  equally divided between proponents and opponents. (In the U.S. House, it is one  hour.) At the conclusion of general debate, each section of the bill is read for  amendment. Amendments written and submitted 24 hours in advance have priority,  and in some instances are the only ones allowed. This means that amendments are  offered in order of the placement of the relevant language in the bill. An  amendment to revise an early section of the bill is out of order if debate has  moved to a later section. You snooze, you lose! Under ordinary procedure,  amendment debate is limited to 2 minutes equally divided. (It is 5 minutes in  the US House.)</p>
    <p>Here's a neat little trick to inject a comment or two into an amendment  debate. The rules permit members to offer an amendment to the amendment,  including pro forma amendments--"to strike the last word." By offering this  motion, a member gets an minute or so to add her 2 cents worth. And if a member  has already been recognized to speak but has run out of time, she can "request  unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds" (for example).</p>
    <p><a name="Amendment_Procedures"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Amendment Procedures</strong></div>
    <p>Congressional amendment procedures are not conducive to on-line voting  because considering all of the alternatives can be time consuming. Nevertheless,  LegSim does offer opportunities to consider amendments on line, and in-class  amending is completely feasible.</p>
    <p>Congress employs amendment procedures that ensure that the original bill and  the existing law will be among that last proposals to be considered. This  "backwards moving agenda" advantages these proposals by ensuring that they are  not eliminated early in the process. Whatever is produced from the amendment  process must ultimately pass the smell test when compared to both the original  bill and existing law.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>First</strong>: Amend the Committee  Substitute?<br />(Repeat until all Amendments are dispensed  with)<br /><strong>Next</strong>: Amend the Bill to incorporate The Committee  Substitute, as Amended?<br /><strong>Last</strong>: Pass the Bill?</p>
    <p>The actual procedures allow for additional amendment opportunities (such as  amendments to amendments - consult Oleszek). This is a very interesting lecture  topic but this simpler process is probably sufficient for your LegSimlature.  LegSim allows members to offer amendments to bills on line as soon as the bill  has been placed on the Union Calendar. On-line votes are then scheduled by the  Speaker, who inserts the text of the amendment into a floor motion, that he or  she then puts up for a vote.</p>
    <p><a name="Germaneness"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Germaneness</strong></div>
    <p>Amendments are in order if they address the subject of the bill and section  under consideration. The purpose of this rule is to keep debate focused.  Germaneness only applies when it is enforced ("Mr. Speaker, I move that the  amendment is non-germane and therefore out of order"). Appeals of the chair's  ruling are in order as usual.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_End_Debate"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to End Debate</strong></div>
    <p>At any time after debate has begun on proposed amendments to a specific  section of a bill, the legislature may consider a procedural motion to close  debate on that section: "Mr. Speaker, I move to close debate." If the motion  passes, no additional amendments are allowed except for those that have been  submitted 24 hours in advance (on-line). These amendments must be  considered.</p>
    <p><a name="Previous_Question"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Previous Question</strong></div>
    <p>A procedural motion to order "the previous question," in contrast, ends ALL  debate on a bill and brings it up for a final vote: "Mr. Speaker, I move the  Previous Question." If the previous question carries, the Speaker then brings  the bill to a final vote by asking: "Shall the bill be engrossed and read a  third time?" If this motion passes by a simple majority, the bill as currently  amended is then brought up for a final vote.</p>
    <p>Special rules drafted by the Rules Committee sometimes state that the  "previous question is considered as ordered on a bill." This means that no  actions are allowed other than those provided in the rule (e.g. no additional  amendments). At the same time, the amendments provided for in the special rule  are guaranteed. The House cannot later move the previous question and expect to  end debate on these amendments.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Recommit"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to Recommit</strong></div>
    <p>Just prior to the vote on final passage, it is in order for a member to offer  one motion to recommit the bill to committee: "Mr. Speaker, I move to recommit  the bill to committee (with instructions)." This is the last chance to defeat a  bill that is bound for passage. It is a significant procedural right for the  minority because it guarantees at least one opportunity to propose an  alternative in a majority dominated process.</p>
    <p>Once again, preparation is essential. A bill that has made it this far is  bound for passage in the absence of a really attractive alternative and a  carefully constructed game plan. The motion is offered with an alternative bill  (these are the "instructions"). The motion is debatable for 10 minutes (divided  equally) and cannot be amended. If it passes, the immediate question is whether  to pass the language it contains in lieu of the bill. Motions to recommit rarely  pass. A famous example occurred in 1980. Although the Democrats controlled the  House, Ronald Reagan was able to persuade southern Democrats to support his  version of the budget, which was contained in a motion to recommit offered by  the minority leader. Scandalous!</p>
    <p><a name="Final_Passage"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Final Passage</strong></div>
    <p>If your bill has made it this far, you are one of the lucky few!</p>
    <p>The Speaker may postpone a recorded vote on final passage for up to two  legislative days. As is true with every motion considered by the LegSimlature,  it is the Speaker's responsibility to ensure that the chamber understands the  question under consideration.</p>
    <p>A 3/5 vote is required to pass a bill that contains a tax increase or  unfunded mandate.</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Reconsider"></a></p>
    <div class="subSubHeader"><strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></div>
    <p>Last, and probably least important of all is the motion to reconsider. After  the final vote, there is one last opportunity to revisit a bill. Since the  minority has already had its chance, the motion to reconsider is little more  than a formality. A member moves to reconsider the bill, another member moves to  table that motion (delay it indefinitely). The motion to table is adopted by  voice vote - end of story.</p>
    <p><a name="Voting"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong>Voting</strong></div>
    <p>There are three methods of voting that occur in sequence; voice, division,  and recorded vote. Typically, a motion is first considered by voice vote. After  time has expired (or no one wishes to speak), a member moves to vote on the  motion. The Chair asks if there is a sufficient second. "There being so, as any  as are in favor say `Aye.' (Wait) ?As many as are opposed, say No." The Chair  then judges the result based on volume ("In the opinion of the chair, the Ayes  have it"). Immediately, any member may demand a division vote: "Mr. Speaker, I  demand a division. The Chair then states: "As many as are in favor will rise and  stand until counted." After counting those standing in favor, he or she then  calls on those opposed to stand. The chair announces the result. Immediately,  any member may request a recorded vote. The Speaker asks if there is a  sufficient second. If at least one-fifth of a quorum indicates their support for  the motion, the vote is recorded. How is up to your LegSimlature. The clerk can  call the roll, members can submit slips of paper, or they can head off to vote  on line. In any case, members' positions must be posted on the LegSim website  (in clear view of their colleagues and constituents!).</p>
    <p><strong>Beware the gavel!</strong></p>
    <p>The Speaker's gavel is a powerful device in the right circumstances. The  sound of the gavel indicates the resolution of an action or motion. It signals  that no additional debate or amendments are in order, and it signals the end of  a vote. A wily Speaker knows how to use her gavel! For example, a Speaker can  bang the gavel to conclude consideration of the bill following a voice vote if  no member moves quickly enough to demand a division or voice vote. (Remember  that the Speaker decides the outcome of a voice vote based on volume, perhaps at  a time when less than a quorum of members is present - gotcha!). Speakers have  also been known to use the gavel to shape the outcome of recorded votes. The  rules require that a recorded vote be open for 20 minutes - but when does it  end? Here the rules are vague. If the Speaker's side is losing, she may hold the  gavel long enough to round up needed additional votes. If you are an undecided  member, this is a fine time to bring out that wish list!</p>
    <p><a name="Motion_to_Adjourn_Sine_Die"></a></p>
    <div class="subHeader"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motion to Adjourn, Sine Die</span></strong></div>
    <p>The last action taken by the House is to adjourn, permanently. Each Congress  spans two years, but the actual date of final adjournment is decided by the  membership, as it is in your case as well. If past courses are any guide, this  will not be an easy decision since the LegSimlature is unlikely to have  dispensed with all of the legislation under consideration (and especially the  most important - yours!). Time marches on however, and you've got a reelection  campaign to run!<a name="Applying_these_procedures_to_online_activities"></a><a name="Applying_these_procedures_to_on-line_activities"></a></p>
    <div class="standardBox"><span class="boxTitle"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applying these procedures  to on-line activities</span></strong></span>
    <p>LegSim advances convenience at some cost to realism. One convenience is that  much of the activity takes place on-line. How much depends on your class and  your instructor. Most of the activities described above can occur on line. Some  activities, such as legislative debate, will proceed differently, with members  having the opportunity to post their views and respond to the views of others  on-line (over days instead of minutes). While it would be possible to construct  a complete set of rules to govern on-line debates, those rules would not reflect  the rules of the real House.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, we do suggest some guidelines that your class may choose to  modify. Under ordinary procedure, bills and resolutions are scheduled for floor  consideration according to the Union Calendar. A bill can be brought up out of  order if the legislature passes a motion (on-line or in class) proposing a  different set of procedures. Under ordinary procedure, members have 48 hours to  cast their votes on on-line motions, and no more than three motions can be  scheduled for votes at any time.</p>
    <p>If you have additional questions about procedure that have not been answered  here, there may not be an answer. In such cases, it is up to the legislature (in  consultation with the parliamentarian) to decide how to proceed.</p>

    <p>Congress divides its workload among approximately 200 committees and  subcommittees. This workload includes evaluating legislative proposals,  overseeing the management of existing programs, and investigating new  issues.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The issue responsibilities of committees are specified in the rules of the  House and Senate (below). The chamber leadership, with the advice of the  parliamentarian typically refers a bill to just one committee. The exceptions  (multiple referrals) usually involve legislation that address issues that cut  across the jurisdictions of multiple committees.</p>

    <p><strong>Congress in its Committees is Congress at Work</strong></p>
    <p>Committees are where much of the work of Congress gets done. They enable  Congress to accomplish more by dividing up tasks and by encouraging lawmakers to  acquire and share policy and political expertise.</p>
    <p>Most legislation is referred to committee for initial consideration. This  right of referral gives the committee of jurisdiction considerable influence  over the progress and substance of legislation.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Proceedings</strong></p>
    <p>The Committee Chair sets the committee agenda. In LegSim, this includes  scheduling <strong>legislative hearings </strong>and <strong>votes</strong> on  <strong>amendments</strong> sponsored by committee members to legislation  referred to the committee, and scheduling <strong>non-legislative</strong> <strong>hearings</strong> on other matters. The committee chair is also  responsible for ensuring that the committee issues a written <strong>committee  report </strong>on any legislation it sends to the floor.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Referrals</strong></p>
    <p>Every bill must be referred to at least one primary committee of referral  within 24 hours of introduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Primary referrals.</strong><strong> </strong>The bill cannot be  placed on the calendar for floor consideration until it has been reported out of  this committee (or committees).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Secondary referrals</strong>. A bill may also be referred to  secondary committees of referral. Bills can be placed on the calendar even if  they have not been reported by secondary committees of referral.</p>

    <p>In the Senate, bills reported from committee are first placed on the&nbsp;calendar. They are then brought up for consideration by the majority leader, who proposes a vote on a motion to proceed. The motion to proceed can be by unanimous consent (UCA) or by majority vote. If the UCA passes the bill can then be scheduled for debate and voting without the possibility of a filibuster. If the motion to proceed passes by majority, the bill can be filibustered.</p>
    <p>Only a Senator who has placed a hold in advance is able to filibuster (by indicating that s/he is 'still debating' when the vote is scheduled. The only vote that can be scheduled on that bill while it is being filibustered is a Cloture motion. If it passes by an absolute 3/5ths of the class, the filibuster ends (according to the terms specified in the cloture motion).</p>
    <p>**Special Note. This floor management process is hard wired into LegSim and may be too cumbersome. However, the instructor/administrator can override it once a bill has been placed on the calendar by going to the 'administration' link at the bottom and clicking on 'manage legislation.'</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
- reference: info-calendar
  copy: |-
    <p>When a committee reports a bill, the Majority Leader places it on the appropriate calendar for possible floor consideration.</p>
    <p>The Senate accords its majority leader prime responsibility for scheduling floor debates. S/he does this by scheduling a vote on a motion to proceed that proposes procedures for the debate. The motion could propose to consider the bill under normal procedures, or something more restrictive. It is just a proposal. The majority leader also decides whether the vote on the motion requires the unanimous consent of the chamber or just a simple majority.</p>
    <p>The motion to proceed is subject to filibuster. This means that a single senator can use his right to unlimited debate to prevent the Senate from bringing consideration of a bill to a close  However, if the motion to proceed limits debate and passes by unanimous consent, then it cannot be filibustered.</p>
    <p>Important! To filibuster in LegSim, a senator must place a hold on the bill before the majority leader has scheduled a vote on ANY motion related to the bill.</p>
    <p>A filibuster ends when the senator stops debating, or the chamber votes 'cloture' (closure), which requires the support of 3/5ths of the chamber.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How a Filibuster works in LegSim</span></strong></p>
    <p>1. The moment a bill is placed on  the calendar any member can register a <strong>Hold</strong> on the bill (in the Senate this is a Notice of Intent to Object to Proceeding.<strong><em> </em></strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>In LegSim, a hold is placed by going to <strong>Clerk  -&gt; Legislative Holds</strong>. Members can both add and remove a hold from this interface.<br /><br />2. The Majority Leader can then propose a floor procedure.  Now, LegSim won't enforce this rule, but if the Majority Leader proposes a floor  procedure too quickly, then members won't have a chance to register holds...  which you'll see is important here in a moment. Floor procedures come in one of  two types<br /><br />&nbsp;-<strong> Unanimous Consent Agreements</strong>: requires zero 'no' votes, but  cannot be filibustered<br />&nbsp;- <strong>Motion to Proceed</strong>: requires simple majority, can be  filibustered<br /><br />The system will provide a draft motion based on which of the  two types of procedure the majority leader selects, but the Majority Leader can/should revise the motion to specify the proposed procedures for the consideration of the bill. <br /><br />3. Once the motion is scheduled, anyone who  has registered a hold -- BEFORE the motion to proceed was scheduled -- can initiate a  filibuster. The vote clock then stops and <strong>no votes</strong> will be allowed until either the filibuster ends or <strong>cloture</strong> is  achieved. The vote clock starts only if all filibuster-ers withdraw, OR...<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The  Majority Leader schedules a cloture vote and the cloture vote passes. Cloture votes require a 3/5ths majority and count  "present" votes as "no" votes. They cannot be filibustered. If the cloture motion is  adopted, the vote clock will start  again (on whatever vote is pending).<br /><br />5. If the motion to proceed is adopted, the legislation in question can now be scheduled for amendment or final passage votes.  Final passage votes are subject to filibusters using the same process described above.</p>

    <p>A Committe Report accompanies a bill that is referred to the floor. It answers a series of specific questions about the bill, organized as sections. Any committee member may draft a report on behalf of the committee, but only the committee chair can report the bill to the floor along with the Committee Report.</p>
    <p>The Report contains two main sections. The <strong>Legislative Text </strong>section contains the Committee's proposed version of the legislation. It could be the original bill, or a different version that reflects revisions considered and recommended by the Committee. The Summary/Report section details the&nbsp; the Committee's deliberations and findings for the benefit of other legislators.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;(abbreviated text)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This Act may be cited as: The Federal Financial Aid Equity Act of 2004 As Reported by the Committee on Education</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for equitable distribution of federal financial assistance. <br /><br />Section 1. Elimination of Guaranteed Allocation.<br /><br />(A): Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Work Study Programs, and Federal Perkins Loans <br /><br />(1) AMENDMENT- Section 413D (20 U.S.C. 1070b-3), Section 442 (42 U.S.C. 2752), and Section 462 (20 U.S.C. 1087bb) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended by striking section (a) in each and inserting the following: <br /><br />(a) ALLOCATION BASED ON PREVIOUS ALLOCATION.&mdash;<br />(1) From the amount appropriated pursuant to section 413A(b) for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall first allocate to each eligible institution an amount equal to 80 percent of the amount such institution received under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for fiscal year 2005 (as such subsections were in effect with respect to allocations for such fiscal year). For fiscal years 2007 through 2009, the percentage shall be reduced to 60, 40, and 20, respectively. <br /><br />Amendments listed in Section 1 shall be in effect for Fiscal Year 2007.</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY/REPORT</strong></p>
    <p>The Summary/Report section summarizes&nbsp;the committee proceedings and findings for the legislature. The Rules of Procedure specify what must be included in a committee report.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;1. Purpose and Summary of the Legislation</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of this bill, the Federal Financial Aid Equity Act of 2004, is to ensure a fair distribution of financial aid to higher education establishments. This will amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for a more equitable distribution of federal financial assistance. The Committee on Education felt as though higher education institutions deserve a fair chance at receiving aid, as students everywhere are burdened with costs of tuition equally.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;2. Background and Need for the Legislation</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;As more Americans are seeking opportunities in Higher Education and needing assistance in obtaining that education, current distribution rules create a disparity in how federal assistance is allocated to institutions. The greatest factor in this disparity is the existence of guaranteed distributions in institutions. To insure the greatest equitable distribution of Federal Educational Aid, such guarantees need to be removed.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Summary of Committee Consideration and Voting</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the request of the committee, Representative Elder appeared and testified on behalf of his bill. The committee requested a proposed amendment containing further background information that provided for a better understanding of the bill&rsquo;s content. The Committee adopted this amendment, along with an amendment to Sec. 1 (a) that spells out the federal financial aid systems in more detail. <br /><br />After debate on PB7, the Committee on Education felt as though the bill was beneficial to higher education institutions as a whole, guaranteeing more equitable support of students in public institutions. <br /><br />Of the nine members present, the final vote to pass this bill out of committee was as follows: <br />9 Yea&rsquo;s <br />0 Nay&rsquo;s <br />0 Abstentions</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">(**There are actually only ten members of this committee, as Rep. Link has never been in attendance.**)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;4. Minority Views</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The only minority views expressed were by members that feared this bill would not be applicable to Representatives serving districts without a higher education institution.</p>
