    <p>Congress divides its workload among approximately 200 committees and subcommittees. This workload includes evaluating legislative proposals, overseeing the management of existing programs, and investigating new issues.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The issue responsibilities of committees are specified in the rules of the House and Senate (below). The chamber leadership, with the advice of the parliamentarian typically refers a bill to just one committee. The exceptions (multiple referrals) usually involve legislation that address issues that cut across the jurisdictions of multiple committees.</p>

    <p>A bill cannot be withdrawn or edited once it has been submitted.  Please draft bills off-line and proofread carefully before you submit. A  sample bill can be found under the Instruction tab.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Legislation</strong>.</p>
    <p>(H. R.) Bills that become public law revise the U.S. Code (below). Bills can vary dramatically in terms of their importance.</p>
    <p>(H. Res) Simple Resolutions do not have the force of law.  They are often used to make statements of support or opposition, and are  also used to propose changes in internal legislative procedures.</p>
    <p>(H.J. Res) Joint Resolutions become law in the same manner as  public bills. The exceptions are Joint Resolutions that propose  amendments to the Constitution, which require 2/3rds support of Congress  to be referred to the states for ratification.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The<strong> Legislative Text</strong> of a bill in LegSim includes the specific proposed legislative language (i.e. how you propose to alter the U.S Code).</p>
    <p>The <strong>Supporting Text </strong>is where the goal of the bill, why it is  needed, and how will will accomplish the goal is described.&nbsp; In other  words, why other lawmakers should support it.</p>

    <p>This page offers legislators the opportunity to nominate and indicate support candidates for chamber leadership positions.</p>
    <p>Actual leadership selection processes are more complicated, and most classes will decide their procedures and make their choices in the classroom.</p>
    <p>In the House, each party caucus informally chooses its nominee, and then votes as a block during the formal process that takes place on the first day of the 2 year Congress. Thus the real action takes place in caucus, where candidates are successively eliminated (lowest vote getter) until one candidate recieves a majority of support in the caucus.</p>
    <p>In the Senate, the presiding officer is the Vice-President. In practice, however, the majority party leader is the <em>de facto</em> leader of the Senate.</p>
    <p>For more information about how congressional leaders are formally chosen, consult the links below.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>About Dear Colleague letters</strong></p>
    <p>In LegSim there are two kinds of dear colleague emails. Ordinary 'dear colleagues' provide a means of communication among legislators and legislative groups. You&nbsp;are encouraged to use&nbsp;ordinary dear colleagues as often as you like.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>"Special" dear colleagues sent&nbsp;to the entire chamber should be restricted to&nbsp;general announcements or to seek general support for legislation, etc. They should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be used to carry on a conversation that everyone in the class is forced to read. In 2008, Congress implemented&nbsp;an e-dearcolleague email system that looks very similar to&nbsp;what LegSim has had for the past 8 years!</p>

    <p><strong>Congress in its Committees is Congress at Work</strong></p>
    <p>Committees are where much of the work of Congress gets done. They enable Congress to accomplish more by dividing up tasks and by encouraging lawmakers to acquire and share policy and political expertise.</p>
    <p>Most legislation is referred to committee for initial consideration. This right of referral gives the committee of jurisdiction considerable influence over the progress and substance of legislation.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Proceedings</strong></p>
    <p>The Committee Chair sets the committee agenda. In LegSim, this includes scheduling <strong>legislative hearings </strong>and <strong>votes</strong> on <strong>amendments</strong> sponsored by committee members to legislation referred to the committee, and scheduling <strong>non-legislative</strong> <strong>hearings</strong> on other matters. The committee chair is also responsible for ensuring that the committee issues a written <strong>committee report </strong>on any legislation it sends to the floor.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Referrals</strong></p>
    <p>Every bill must be referred to at least one primary committee of referral  within 24 hours of introduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Primary referrals.</strong><strong> </strong>The bill cannot be placed on the calendar  for floor consideration until it has been reported out of this committee (or  committees).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Secondary referrals</strong>. A bill may also be referred to  secondary committees of referral. Bills can be placed on the calendar even if  they have not been reported by secondary committees of referral.</p>

A vote on the report can't occur until a report has been drafted (and a report can't be drafted until a hearing has been opened).</p>
