    <p>Congress divides its workload among approximately 200 committees and subcommittees. This workload includes evaluating legislative proposals, overseeing the management of existing programs, and investigating new issues.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The issue responsibilities of committees are specified in the rules of the House and Senate (below). The chamber leadership, with the advice of the parliamentarian typically refers a bill to just one committee. The exceptions (multiple referrals) usually involve legislation that address issues that cut across the jurisdictions of multiple committees.</p>

    <p><strong>Types of Legislation</strong>.</p>
    <p>(S.) Bills that become public law revise the U.S. Code (below). Bills can vary dramatically in terms of their importance.</p>
    <p><strong></strong> (S. Res) Simple Resolutions do not have the force of law. They are often used to make statements of support or opposition, and are also used to propose changes in internal legislative procedures.</p>
    <p><strong></strong>(S.J. Res) Joint Resolutions become law in the same manner as public bills. The exceptions are Joint Resolutions that propose amendments to the Constitution, which require 2/3rds support of Congress to be referred to the states for ratification.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The<strong> Legislative Text</strong> of a bill in LegSim includes the specific proposed legislative language (i.e. how you propose to alter the U.S Code).</p>
    <p>The <strong>Supporting Text </strong>is where the goal of the bill, why it is needed, and how will will accomplish the goal is described.&nbsp; In other words, why other lawmakers should support it.</p>

    <p>This page offers legislators the opportunity to nominate and indicate support candidates for chamber leadership positions.</p>
    <p>Actual leadership selection processes are more complicated, and most classes will decide their procedures and make their choices in the classroom.</p>
    <p>In the House, each party caucus informally chooses its nominee, and then votes as a block during the formal process that takes place on the first day of the 2 year Congress. Thus the real action takes place in caucus, where candidates are successively eliminated (lowest vote getter) until one candidate recieves a majority of support in the caucus.</p>
    <p>In the Senate, the presiding officer is the Vice-President. In practice, however, the majority party leader is the <em>de facto</em> leader of the Senate.</p>

    <p>In LegSim there are two kinds of dear colleague emails. Ordinary 'dear colleagues' provide a means of communication among legislators and legislative groups. You&nbsp;are encouraged to use&nbsp;ordinary dear colleagues as often as you like.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>"Special" dear colleagues sent&nbsp;to the entire chamber should be restricted to&nbsp;general announcements or to seek general support for legislation, etc. They should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be used to carry on a conversation that everyone in the class is forced to read.

    <p><strong>Congress in its Committees is Congress at Work</strong></p>
    <p>Committees are where much of the work of Congress gets done. They enable Congress to accomplish more by dividing up tasks and by encouraging lawmakers to acquire and share policy and political expertise.</p>
    <p>Most legislation is referred to committee for initial consideration. This right of referral gives the committee of jurisdiction considerable influence over the progress and substance of legislation.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Proceedings</strong></p>
    <p>The Committee Chair sets the committee agenda. In LegSim, this includes scheduling <strong>legislative hearings </strong>and <strong>votes</strong> on <strong>amendments</strong> sponsored by committee members to legislation referred to the committee, and scheduling <strong>non-legislative</strong> <strong>hearings</strong> on other matters. The committee chair is also responsible for ensuring that the committee issues a written <strong>committee report </strong>on any legislation it sends to the floor.</p>
    <p><strong>Committee Referrals</strong></p>
    <p>Every bill must be referred to at least one primary committee of referral  within 24 hours of introduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Primary referrals.</strong><strong> </strong>The bill cannot be placed on the calendar  for floor consideration until it has been reported out of this committee (or  committees).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Secondary referrals</strong>. A bill may also be referred to  secondary committees of referral. Bills can be placed on the calendar even if  they have not been reported by secondary committees of referral.</p>

    <p><strong>Scheduling Bills and Resolutions for Floor Consideration</strong></p>
    <p>Bill that are&nbsp;reported from committee are&nbsp;placed on the&nbsp;calendar. In the House, under ordinary procedure, bills are then scheduled for floor consideration in the order in which they were placed on the calendar. Thus, the first one to be placed on the calendar is the first to be brought to the floor. The other option is to bring a bill up out of order by passing a special rule proposed by the Rules committee.</p>
    <p>In the Senate, a bill that has been reported from committee must first be place on the calendar. The Senate has a <strong>legislative calendar</strong> for legislative matters, and an <strong>executive calendar</strong> for matters involving the executive branch (e.g. confirmations).</p>
    <p>Once a bill has been placed on the calendar, the majority leader proposes a '<strong>motion to proceed</strong>' to consideration of the bill, either by unanimous consent or by a simple majority. If the motion passes by unanimous consent, the bill can then be scheduled according to the terms laid out in the motion to proceed.</p>
    <p>If the Senate passes the motion to proceed by a simple majority,&nbsp; a vote on the bill can now be scheduled but it may be filibustered. A filibuster can only be ended if 3/5ths of the Senate votes <strong>cloture</strong> (or closure).</p>
    <p>In LegSim, a senator initiates a filibuster by indicating that he is 'still debating' on a motion that has been scheduled for a vote. If one or more senators are 'still debating' the only motion in order on that bill is cloture - which is also scheduled by the majority leader.</p>
    <p>The majority leader need to propose the terms of the cloture motion. If it passes by a 3/5th majority, voting on the bill (or amendment) proceeds. However it is important that the majority lead abide by whatever terms were included in the cloture motion.</p>
- reference: info-calendar
  copy: |-
    <p>When a committee reports a bill, the Majority Leader places it on the appropriate calendar for possible floor consideration.</p>
    <p>The Senate accords its Chamber Leader (Constitutionally, the Vice President or President Pro-Tempore; in practice, the Majority Party leader) prime responsibility for scheduling floor debates.S/he can do this by seeking a <strong>Unanimous Consent Agreement</strong> (UCA) from lawmakers to bring a bill up at a particular point in time according to a proposed set of procedures.</p>
    <p>In the absence of a UCA, the Chamber Leader can make a <strong>Motion to Proceed</strong> to consideration of the bill.&nbsp; This 'motion to proceed' must be formally adopted by the Senate and is debateable (and therefore subject to filibuster).</p>
    <p>A senator who objects to a proposed UCA or motion to Proceed can file a .</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How a Filibuster works in LegSim</span></strong></p>
    <p>1. The moment a bill is placed on  the calendar any member can register a <strong>Hold</strong> on the bill (in the Senate this is a Notice of Intent to Object to Proceeding.<strong><em> </em></strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>In LegSim, a hold is placed by going to <strong>Clerk  -&gt; Legislative Holds</strong>. Members can both add and remove a hold from this interface.<br /><br />2. The Majority Leader can then propose a floor procedure.  Now, LegSim won't enforce this rule, but if the Majority Leader proposes a floor  procedure too quickly, then members won't have a chance to register holds...  which you'll see is important here in a moment. Floor procedures come in one of  two types<br /><br />&nbsp;-<strong> Unanimous Consent Agreements</strong>: requires zero 'no' votes, but  cannot be filibustered<br />&nbsp;- <strong>Motion to Proceed</strong>: requires simple majority, can be  filibustered<br /><br />The system will provide a draft motion based on which of the  two types of procedure the majority leader selects, but the Majority Leader can/should revise the motion to specify the proposed procedures for the consideration of the bill. <br /><br />3. Once the motion is scheduled, anyone who  has registered a hold -- BEFORE the motion to proceed was scheduled -- can initiate a  filibuster. The vote clock then stops and <strong>no votes</strong> will be allowed until either the filibuster ends or <strong>cloture</strong> is  achieved. The vote clock starts only if all filibuster-ers withdraw, OR...<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The  Majority Leader schedules a cloture vote and the cloture vote passes. Cloture votes require a 3/5ths majority and count  "present" votes as "no" votes. They cannot be filibustered. If the cloture motion is  adopted, the vote clock will start  again (on whatever vote is pending).<br /><br />5. If the motion to proceed is adopted, the legislation in question can now be scheduled for amendment or final passage votes.  Final passage votes are subject to filibusters using the same process described above.</p>

    <p>The chamber leader schedules when each on-line vote begins and when it ends, and whether a vote can be filibustered. The LegSim rules of procedure specify that&nbsp;on-line votes must be open for 48 hours and that no more than 3 votes can occur on-line at one time.</p>

    <p>When committee voting is enabled by the instructor, there are two general options for voting. One is to schedule an on-line vote. The other is to enter a previous vote.</p>
    <p>In both cases, the dropdown box to the left asks you to specify the type of motion that is being voted on and to confirm or enter the substance of the motion being voted on.</p>
    <p><strong>Reporting a bill</strong>. In committee, the most important vote is the vote to 'adopt the committee report.' If the committee report is adopted, the bill is automatically reported to the chamber leader. A vote on the report can't occur until a report has been drafted (and a report can't be drafted until a hearing has been opened).</p>
